Welcome to my little corner of the Internet! If you didn't find this
site by accident, odds are you've seen me speak at [No Fluff Just
Stuff](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home/main), a user group
meeting or one of the several conferences I've been lucky enough to
speak at! Want to know more about me? Check out my
[biography](about.html). Curious about my presentation style? You
can learn all about it at [Presentation Patterns](http://presentationpatterns.com).
