## Nathaniel's Long Bio
Nathaniel T. Schutta is a solution architect in the Twin Cities area
of Minnesota with extensive experience developing Java Enterprise Edition based Web applications. He graduated from [St. Johnâ€™s University (MN)](http://www.csbsju.edu) with a degree in Computer Science and has a master's of science degree in software engineering from the [University of Minnesota](http://www.msse.umn.edu). For the last several years, he has focused on user interface design. Nathaniel has contributed to corporate interface
guidelines and consulted on a variety of Web-based applications. A long-time member of the Association for Computing Machinery's
Computer-Human Interaction Special Interest Group and a Sun-certified Web component developer, Nathaniel believes that if the user can't
figure out your application, then you've done something wrong. Along with his user interface work, Nathaniel is the cocreator of the
open-source Taconite framework, has contributed to two corporate Java frameworks, has developed training material, and has led several study
groups. During the brief moments of warm weather found in his home
state of Minnesota, he spends as much time on the golf course as his
wife will tolerate. He's currently exploring Clojure and Clojure
Script. Nathaniel is the coauthor of three books, Foundations of Ajax,
Pro Ajax and Java Frameworks and Presentation Patterns.
