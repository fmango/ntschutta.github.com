Like most people in this line of work, I work in a cube so I really identified with a <a href="http://www.ks95.com/">local radio station</a>'s "<a href="http://ks95.com/upload/song_cubicle.mp3">my cubicle</a>" - a play on <a href="http://www.jamesblunt.com/">James Blunt</a>'s hit <a href="http://www.google.com/musics?lid=HzIrEI6MmgM&aid=-jDzrDyU3f&sid=gCltcdSiM9I">You're Beautiful</a>.  Thanks to Andy for passing that my way!
