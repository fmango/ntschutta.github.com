The glamours life that is the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/10/18/upcoming-events/">speaking circuit</a>.  Last night around 8 PM I picked my lovely wife up at exotic <a href="http://www.mspairport.com/msp/">MSP</a> only to return 12 hours later to fly to Toronto for the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=73">NF event</a>.  In general I like MSP - well, I'm familiar with it - but I have to say, "they" have really sucked the romance out of travel.  Off with your shoes, take off your belt, put your laptop through separately please, take out your little plastic baggy full of travel size liquids and gels, throw that water away...  Man - these <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/index.shtm">new rules</a> <strong>*must*</strong> be a boon for the in airport kiosk industry.

But you know what the secret is?  Never forget, the people working here are doing their best (mostly) and their just following orders.  Be civil to them and you'll be amazed at what you get in return.  I know, some of them are, well, dinks, but a smile and a warm comment go a long way.  At least it does for me - YMMV.

Today I'm flying out of good old concourse A, a relatively new part of MSP and one I've never been to.  The kindly woman who checked me in (and also shared a neat little trick, what did I say about that smile?  No, I'm not telling...) was right - it is half way to <a href="http://www.ci.stillwater.mn.us/">Stillwater</a>!  I hope I'm not flying on the plane I see out the window...what was that I said about glamour?

Most of the time I'm traveling out of the main part of the airport where you can't go fifty feet without running into a <a href="http://www.cariboucoffee.com/">Caribou</a> or a <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/">McDonald's</a> but when you're at A, you better be ready for the duration.  Or have the time to run back to C.  Seriously, vending machines are you options down here (but they are cheaper...)  One thing I can't figure out though - why does the "the walkway is ending" voice have a British accent?  Is that particular vernacular more comforting to international travelers?  Oh well, in a few hours I'll be in Toronto settled in for what I'm sure will be a great weekend and then off to Boston for <strong>*the*</strong> <a href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/show_view.jsp?showId=59">event of the fall</a>.  Other than missing my wife, I'm pumped!
