If you're actually interested in <strong>*hearing*</strong> Ryan and I, we now have <a href="/talks/foundations-of-ajax.mp3">audio</a>!  <ins datetime="2006-03-18T03:31:15+00:00">(Update: oops - fixed the link, sorry about that!  Thanks <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/15/audio-of-our-uw-la-crosse-talk/#comment-199">Bob</a>!  Oh, and my wife says that doesn't sound like me...but the audio is still good.)</ins>  Our talk at <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/04/uw-la-crosse-talk/">UW La Crosse</a> was recorded (<a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/04/uw-la-crosse-talk/#comment-156">rumor has it</a> there is video too) and Larry Sleznikow was kind enough to convert the talk to an MP3.  The audio is quite good (though we don't <em>quite</em> sound like that in person...at least I don't <strong>think</strong> we do) and the running time is just over an hour.  Enjoy!
