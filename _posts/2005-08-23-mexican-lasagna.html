Rachael Ray's Mexican Lasagna</a>

I'm a big fan of Rachael Ray and I've had a ton of success with almost every recipe of hers that I've tried.  They're quick (her shtick is 30 minute meals) and easy to make.  Check out any of her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=pd_sc/102-7869714-8534524?index=blended&field-keywords=rachael%20ray%2030%20minute%20meal">great cookbooks</a>!  There you go Joe, don't say I never did nothin for ya!
