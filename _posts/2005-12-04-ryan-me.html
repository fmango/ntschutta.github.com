On the off chance that you want to see what Ryan and I look like, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen">Roumen</a> <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen?entry=new_t_shirts_of_authors">posted a couple of pictures</a> of us.  We're modeling the stylish shirts the kind folks at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> sent us (thanks again!)  This pictures were taken by my lovely wife (who is also extremely patient - she did sit around and listen to us talk for a couple of hours) just after <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/11/17/tc-jug-slides/">our talk</a> at <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JavaUserGroup.aspx">TC JUG</a>.  As we've mentioned before, we wrote all the examples in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590595823/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&#038;n=283155&#038;s=books&#038;v=glance&#038;tagActionCode=ntschuttacom-20">Foundations of Ajax</a> using NetBeans.  Seriously - if you haven't tried NetBeans in a while, you really should, I'm a convert, enough so that I added a banner to my site.  And no, I don't earn fees from anything you see on the sidebar - they are all organizations I feel strongly about supporting.

Speaking of talks - just a quite reminder that I'll be <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/11/23/code-freeze/">talking</a> at <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/index.html">Code Freeze 2006</a> in January - if you're in the Twin Cities area I hope to see you there.  Also, Ryan and I will be speaking at <a href="http://www.otug.org/">OTUG</a> in April.  There is also a pretty good chance I'll be talking at <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/">St. John's</a> in the spring sometime.
