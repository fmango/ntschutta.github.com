This week, Ryan and I spoke at <a href="http://www.uwlax.edu/">UW La Crosse</a>.  The event was fantastic and we had a blast - special thanks to <a href="http://www.cs.uwlax.edu/~kasi/">Dr. Kasi Periyasamy</a> and the <a href="http://www.cs.uwlax.edu/">Computer Science</a> club for inviting us down!  The event was recorded and I'm hoping to post the audio (maybe even the video...we'll see) but in the meantime, here's the <a href="/slides/Foundations of Ajax UWL.pdf">slide deck</a>.  <a href="http://www.backupbrain.com/">Dori</a> would be happy to know that nearly half (yes half) of the attendees were women!

Since some people were very interested in the links, I'm also posting both the <a href="/slides/Ajax and the Enterprise.pdf">paper</a> and the set of <a href="/slides/code freeze links.rtf">links</a> from my talk at <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/16/code-freeze-slides/">Code Freeze</a>.
