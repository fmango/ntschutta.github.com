I was really happy to hear that an <a href="http://jroller.com/page/GearDaddie">old friend</a> was starting to <a href="http://jroller.com/page/GearDaddie?entry=evaluating_ruby_and_rails">explore Ruby and Rails</a>!  I haven't had an excuse to use Ruby or Rails in anger yet, but that hasn't stopped me from <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/06/railsconf-2006/">heading to RailsConf</a> (speaking of which, a <a href="http://railsconf.org/articles/2006/02/14/expanded-venue-registration-re-open">fresh batch of seats</a> is now open - I'm glad it's so successful but I was really looking forward to the "exclusivity" of the event.)  So, do you have <a href="http://www.railsconf.org/pages/registration">YOUR</a> ticket yet?
