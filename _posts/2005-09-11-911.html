Today is a always a bitter-sweet day for me.  For any American, 9/11 is one of those "where were you when you heard days" - I was just coming out of an early meeting with Dan V. and walked by Linnea and Andrea's "pod" where they were talking about it with their manager.  I hadn't heard until right then but stunned disbelief doesn't convey my feelings appropriately.  We ended up watching much of the day unfold on the TVs in our company's fitness center.

Of course 9/11 didn't just touch residents of the United States, 83 other countries also lost husbands and wives, friends, mothers and fathers, daughters and sons that fateful day in 2001.  Today is also my <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/09/11/happy-birthday-christine/">wife's birthday</a> and truthfully it always feels a tad odd to celebrate on a day like this but then, it would have been on someone's birthday so what are you going to do.  For me, those days in 2001 were particularly hard - on the the 9th of September I sat with Christine at the gate (remember when you could actually wait with or pick someone up at the gate!) as she prepared to board a plane to India.  So, when 9/11 happened, my wife was half a world away.

I've been watching some of the documentaries about 9/11 recently and it's really amazing, even four years later, to hear the stories, to see the pictures.  I'm always moved by the heroism that was on display as firefighters and other rescue workers, who surely knew the danger yet rushed in to help.  To the men and women who put their lives on the line everyday to protect and serve, a thousand times, thank you.

I recall a quote about dealing with loss that basically said, the larger the chasm left by the loss, the more room you have to fill with love.  Though a tragedy of unparalleled proportion, 9/11 also displayed the tremendous courage of our firefighters, policemen, first responders, and everyday citizens; the character displayed during 9/11 is enough to restore one's faith in humanity.  To all those that lost loved ones, to those brave men and women that ran towards danger, my heart goes out to you today.
