If you've read my blog for any length of time, you've probably seen me reference (<a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/10/26/no-esta-firmado-ni-fechado/">here</a> and <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/17/nfjs-day-1/">here</a>) <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/articles/ArtInProgramming.pdf">The Art in Computer Programming</a> by <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/">Andy Hunt</a> and <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a>.  I first encountered this piece last year when Dave gave a fantastic keynote at <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">NFJS</a> so when I saw <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/articles/2006/03/17/the-art-in-programming-now-with-real-art">this post</a> on Andy's blog last week I had to point to it.  <a href="http://www.developerdotstar.com/">DeveloperDotStar</a> has taken <a href="http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/art_computer_programming.html">their work and added links</a> to the art mentioned throughout - it's almost as good as seeing Andy or Dave present live...almost!
