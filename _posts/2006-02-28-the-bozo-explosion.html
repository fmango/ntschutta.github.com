<a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> has a great post: "<a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/02/how_to_prevent_.html">How to Prevent a Bozo Explosion</a>".  How many is your company guilty of?  What about <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scoble</a>'s <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/02/26/is-your-company-seeing-a-bozo-explosion/">additions</a>?  More importantly - what are you doing about it?

I hate to admit how many of these I've seen over the years but there are some great messages in these posts.  I've been very intrigued by the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/20/what-can-you-do-without/">concept</a>  of <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/constraints_breed_breakthrough_creativity.php">constraints</a> and what they <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/08/cut-the-fat/">can mean</a> to a software organization (see Kathy's <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/creativity_on_s.html">post</a> for more).  One lesson of the bubble - growing <strong>REALLY</strong> big <strong>REALY</strong> fast with <strong>LOTS</strong> of cash isn't the answer...  I also think Guy's advice about looking beyond the resume is important - how many great candidates to you think Google has flushed because they didn't go to the right school?

There were a couple of bits in Robert's additions that really caught my eye especially the one about changing the spec...  And I think you know where I stand on <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/26/make-meetings-useful/">meetings</a>!
