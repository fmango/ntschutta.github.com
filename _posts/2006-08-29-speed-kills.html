Back at dear old <a title="CSB/SJU website" href="http://csbsju.edu/">SJU</a>, <a title="Johnnie Football" href="http://www.gojohnnies.com/football/default.htm">John Gagliardi</a> (<a title="Gag's inducted to hall of fame" href="http://www.gojohnnies.com/football/times050906.htm">recent inductee</a> to the <a title="College HOF" href="http://www.collegefootball.org/">College Football Hall of Fame</a>) was fond of saying "speed kills."  Of course this was in relation to quick footed running backs or wide receivers but the adage works in other contexts as well.  As I mentioned <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/08/29/rails-java/">earlier</a>, <a title="But Uncle Bob" href="http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob">Uncle Bob</a> has been getting into the Ruby space and today he posted a very interesting <a title="Speed of Java, C++, Ruby" href="http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.SpeedOfJavaCppRuby">comparison of the speed</a> of an algorithm written in Java, C++, and Ruby.  While Ruby code is relatively slow (and the C++ wasn't highly optimized) there's more to this game than raw processing speed.

I'm not saying we should write slow code - far from it.  But, there are other considerations such as developer productivity and long term maintenance costs.  While there certainly are some applications that absolutely <strong>*must*</strong> run full bore, I suspect quite a few businesses would take a moderately slower application if it meant their development staff could deliver working code faster.  And I can't second this notion fast enough:
<blockquote>I'd rather have simple, clean, maintainable code over even 1.5 orders of magnitude in many cases.</blockquote>
Amen.
