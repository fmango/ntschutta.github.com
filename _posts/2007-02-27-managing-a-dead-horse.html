I'm pretty sure that <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/">Scott Adams</a> has some kind of super sniffer that gives him direct access to all emails, IMs, or search records of anyone in software or engineering.  I say that partially because <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2007026109124.gif">last Friday</a>'s <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/index.html">Dilbert</a> hit pretty close to home - you see a couple of months back my buddy Charles IMed me <a href="http://www.onsetsoftware.com/jokes.htm">this link to a bunch of jokes</a> and I about fell off my chair laughing at the bit about riding a dead horse (scroll down - it's there, trust me).  I'm sure we've all experienced a few of those over the years...  Coincidence?  I think not!
