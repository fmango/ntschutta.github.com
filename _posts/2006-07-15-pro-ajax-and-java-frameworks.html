Ryan and I are proud to announce our second collaboration, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1590596773%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1152987234%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8">Pro Ajax and Java Frameworks</a>!  We just got our author copies so I expect it will be available shortly from the major retailers.  This book largely picks up where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&s=books">Foundations</a> ends: after a general Ajax overview, we cover some common tools (including my new favorite <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/">Firebug</a>) then we discuss a number of frameworks (<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>, <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us</a>, <a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net/">DWR</a>, etc).  Once we've covered the client side goodness, we walk readers through integrating Ajax into common Java frameworks including <a href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts</a>, <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/">JSF</a>, <a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/">Tapestry</a>, and <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a>.

We've been thrilled with how well received Foundations has been and we hope people learn as much from reading Pro Ajax as we did writing it!
