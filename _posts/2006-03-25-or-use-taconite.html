I'm not sure about you, but on more than one occasion, I've been asked to write a confirmation dialog.  As a UI guy, I usually push back since most people get into the habit of clicking through them so the one time the mean to hit "No" it's too late, muscle memory has already sent their work to oblivion.  Anyway, the other day Joe Athman sent me a link to <a href="http://www.d3eministry.net/wordpress/">Joe Vasquez</a>'s article <a href="http://www.d3eministry.net/wordpress/2006/03/23/147/">AJAX Delete Confirmation</a> pointing out that the author mentions <a href="http://taconite.sourceforge.net/">Taconite</a>!  Thanks Joe for writing about our little framework (and thanks to Joe for forwarding the link on to me).
