Today was a tough day.  Oh sure, I've been a developer long enough (heck, I've been alive long enough) to realize that the only constant is change but that didn't make today any easier.  Today, a good friend said goodbye and while I know I'll see him and his family again soon, and despite the fact that I've known it was coming for several months it still hurt to say farewell.

I've worked with Casey for almost four years now and I have to admit, tomorrow is going to be really strange.  It didn't help that a contractor literally moved into his cube as he was leaving (such is the corporate world) but I really don't know what to expect when I walk by in the morning and he's not there.

I won't get into anything "mushy" here (did enough of that in person today) but there is one thing I will add here.  Casey - thanks for the compliments about my teaching ability but I want to thank you for being such a good student.  Thanks for asking questions!  Without great students, there can be no great teachers - thanks for making my job so darn enjoyable for the last four years!

I'm a "quote of the day" kind of guy so its no surprise that in times like this, I'm turning to someone else's words.  I have a feeling I'll be repeating this to myself quite a bit over the next few weeks:


<blockquote>
"Don't be dismayed at goodbyes, a farewell is necessary before you can meet again and meeting again, after moments or lifetimes, is certain for those who are friends."

To Casey, Julia and Gunny, I wish you all the best on you're grand adventure; you'll do great and we're really happy for you!
