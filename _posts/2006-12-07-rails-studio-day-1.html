<a href="http://www.familyguy.com/">And it begins</a>! First off, they've got the big three: wifi, power, and caffeine, you can tell <a href="http://clarkware.com/">Mike</a> and <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave</a> have done this before ;) Day one is a half day Ruby tutorial and then what I'd describe as roughly the first seven chapters of <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails2/index.html">AWR</a>. The crowd is a little quiet but all in all some good questions. So far the real value is hearing Dave and Mike pipe in with tips and tricks. No matter how many times I <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts">see</a> how fast you can get basic CRUD up with Rails, it never stops impressing me.

All in all, nothing too revolutionary today but I suspect tomorrow (again, this will be posted after the fact!) will really get things started. One thing I have to say - I really like the pace of the South. We've eaten out a couple of times now and each time they really stressed "y'all just hang around as long as you like." I'm starting to understand what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_hospitality">Southern hospitality</a> is all about.
