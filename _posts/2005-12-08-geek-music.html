Now maybe <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/04/you-know-youre-getting-older-when/">I'm not hip anymore</a> and maybe we geeks just aren't very "cool" but darn it, we can sing!  I've been meaning to mention <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen">Roumen</a>'s <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen?entry=i_ve_recorded_a_netbeans">NetBeans song</a> for some time now.  First of all, the lyrics are fantastic but you really need to <a href="http://roumen.name/blog/netbeans_song/netbeans_song.mp3">listen</a> to him sing it!  If you don't think <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> is worth checking out yet, the song should convince you ;)

When I first stumbled on the NetBeans Song, I certainly didn't realize that this was a trend!  Today I was catching up on some of my podcasts when I gave Michael Mahemoff's <a href="http://softwareas.com/index.php?name=ajax-basics-podcast-1&page=">Basics of Ajax</a> podcast a listen.  <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/">Ajax Patterns</a> is a great resource (I'm very interested in the <a href="http://softwareas.com/index.php?name=ajax-design-patterns-book&page=">book</a>!) and I also enjoy <a href="http://softwareas.com/">Software As She's Developed</a>.  What really stood out in this particular podcast though was the very end where he included <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/">OK-Cancel</a>'s first-rate <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/archives/feature/2004/02/worlds-first-hci-rap-we-got-it.html">HCI Rap "We Got It."</a>  Now, you really have to be a geek to fully appreciate it but trust me, you have to give this a <a href="http://s90180263.onlinehome.us/www.OK-Cancel.com%20-%20We%20Got%20It.mp3">listen</a>!  I'm a closet HCI guy and I was really jamming along, but, apparently I still can't dance...  Are there other examples of geek music out there?
