By now, my humble readers (pretty sure I'm up to five or six now) should know I have a <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/18/nfjs-quotes/">thing for quotes</a> and as you might expect, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/category/railsconf/">RailsConf</a> provided it's share of notable quips!  I should point out that I'm not a reporter and I didn't record any of the sessions so I'm mostly paraphrasing (if I've misquoted someone, I'll happily change it, just let me know).  Anyway, here are my favorite lines from the weekend.

When discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> and also the buzz behind <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> itself <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> said:


<blockquote>"There's a move afoot in our industry to throw away all of the crap."</blockquote>



When discussing Ajax, Dave defined it as "making browsers suck less" following with:


<blockquote>"The browser is just a 3270 terminal that can display porn."
</blockquote>


<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/index.html">Paul Graham</a> is one of my favorite writers - when he posts something new, I pretty much drop everything, print it out, and read it.  The following all belong to him.  Before diving into his <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/23/railsconf-day-1/">keynote</a>, Paul prepared us for what was about to come:


<blockquote>"I'm going to contradict both the Old Testament and Yoda."</blockquote>



<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html">His talk itself</a> provided quite a number of quotable lines including...


<blockquote>"Better to say something obliquely, then the people that would be offended won't understand it."
</blockquote>

and


<blockquote>"Don't learn things from people that are bad at them."
</blockquote>


Paul was followed up by <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">Why the Luck Stiff</a> and anyone that has seen him live knows how entertaining he is.  While I can't do justice to nearly anything he said during his show, I loved this line (if i recall properly, this caused a standing O from <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn Vanderburg</a>):


<blockquote>"Put your best practices away."
</blockquote>


Obviously, there were other memorable lines, but these were the ones I actually caught in my notes...
