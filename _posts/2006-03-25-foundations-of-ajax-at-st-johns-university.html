Last Thursday, my wife and I hopped into the car and made the journey back my alma mater, <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/">St. John's University</a> where I gave a talk about Ajax.  <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~mheroux/">Mike Heroux</a> was kind enough to invite me up and I really enjoyed chatting with my old (you know what I mean!) adviser <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~jschnepf/">Jim Schnepf</a> (sorry I couldn't summon a wittier dedication), <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~jmiller/">John Miller</a>, and <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~jholey/">Andy Holey</a>.  My four years at SJU were a real highlight for me and every time I go back behind the Pine Curtain is special.  The talk was great, we had a good crowd that asked some great questions so thanks to everyone that attended!  And clearly I forgot just how <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/record/archives/2004-2005/10-07-04/variety/pizza_wars.html">good Gary's Pizza</a> is...

Anywho, here are the <a href="/slides/Foundations of Ajax SJU.pdf">slides</a> from my talk and for those of you that weren't there, a <a href="/slides/Ajax and the Enterprise.pdf">paper</a> that might help fill in the gaps a bit and a copy of the <a href="/slides/code freeze links.rtf">links</a>.
