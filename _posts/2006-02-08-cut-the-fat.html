A while back, I wrote about two of the most dangerous words in the programing world - <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/21/what-if/">what if</a>.  Like many before me, I've been on teams that were stuck in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">analysis paralysis</a> before and I can't tell you <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/26/make-meetings-useful/">how many meetings</a> I've attended that quickly devolved when people started tossing out loaded phrases like "well, I could see a customer doing..." or "you know, I think it'd be nice if..."  Hey, I've been guilty of <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/rdenum.htm">gold plating</a> from time to time, but I've grown - I fully accept <a href="http://xp.c2.com/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YAGNI</a> in my life.  Now, along with a blood sacrifice, I demand living breathing proof that we need to implement a feature...who am I kidding, I don't have that kind of clout.

The next time you're sitting around trying to figure out what you feature you <strong>*must*</strong> have in your next release, just ask: <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/essential_vs_nonessential.php">is it essential or not</a>?  Of course that doesn't mean you should <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/11/02.html">ship utter garbage</a> either...and don't get me started on all the <a href="http://www.cybergrain.com/archives/2004/11/google_betas_ar.html">beta-ware</a> out there!
