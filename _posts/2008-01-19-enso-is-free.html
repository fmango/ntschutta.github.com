In case you missed it, I just wanted to point out that <a href="http://humanized.com/enso/">Enso</a>, a program launcher (though really, that description doesn't do the product justice) is <a href="http://humanized.com/weblog/2008/01/15/if-you-love-something-set-it-free/">now free</a>! I've been following Enso since <a href="http://humanized.com/">Humanized</a> announced it and I was really impressed by the things Aza was <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/09/20/reflections-on-rwe/">showing off at the Rich Web Experience</a>. If you've ever seen <a href="http://www.nealford.com/">Neal Ford</a>'s <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=740">productive programmer</a> talks, you know he's a fan as well, and after using it for an afternoon, I already can't imagine working on a Windows box without it. The user interface is remarkable - give it a try, you won't regret it!
