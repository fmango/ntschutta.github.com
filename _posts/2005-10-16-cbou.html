My beloved <a href="http://www.cariboucoffee.com/">Caribou Coffee</a> went public a few weeks ago and thanks to <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/10/16/october-is-the-new-june/">Elder</a> I was able to partake of the IPO.  Unfortunately they haven't done a <a href="http://smartmoney.com/eqsnaps/index.cfm?story=snapshot&symbol=GOOG">Google</a> but then I didn't expect them to and, frankly, that isn't why I bought the stock.  I've been a loyal Caribou drinker since Elder introduced me way back in 1998 so I guess I look at this as more of a hedge.  Considering what my household spends at the 'Bou in a given year, the stock practically paid for itself.  If you live here in Minnie than you've probably seen <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=192910&p=irol-irhome">quite a number</a> of 'Bous - if you don't then just wait, they're coming!  Even if I wasn't a <a href="http://smartmoney.com/eqsnaps/index.cfm?story=snapshot&symbol=CBOU">shareholder</a> I would still strongly urge you to check them out.
