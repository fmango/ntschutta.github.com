I'm a little tardy in getting the <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/san_jose/2007/09/index.html">Rich Web Experience</a> written up, I hope you'll forgive me. First off, I just want to thank the attendees - what a great audience! They were very engaged, asked a ton of great questions and really made for a fun few days for the speakers. In an neat bit of coincidence, I met <a href="http://www.joshholmes.com/default.aspx">Josh Holmes</a> from Microsoft on the plane out to San Jose - we spent most of the ride talking about <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> though his <a href="http://www.joshholmes.com/2007/08/14/AdventuresWithMappingAndOffroadFun.aspx">trip to Crested Butte</a> was quite something! Anyway, I hope <a href="http://molly.com/">Molly Holzschlag</a> is feeling better; her presence was missed but at least the opening panel <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/09/06/rich-web_1.html">managed to make InfoWorld</a> (you can't spell filibuster without <a href="http://www.davisworld.org/">Scott Davis</a> :) ).

Having no talks Thursday, I settled in with a full helping of <a href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/">Bill Scott</a> and <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Doug Crockford</a>. Bill <a href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/2007/09/announcing-protoscript.html">introduced</a> <a href="http://protoscript.com/">Protoscript</a>, a "simplified scripting language for creating Ajax style prototypes for the Web." I thought it was a pretty interesting tool and something that could really help those of us that build UI mockups (read more <a href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/2007/09/why-protoscript.html">here</a>). Doug talked about, you guessed it, JavaScript a topic near and dear to his heart (check out his stuff on <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/">YUI Theater</a> to get a taste of what you missed).

Friday I had to go to work! I opened up with my <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/show_session_view.jsp?presentationId=287&showId=60">Designing for Ajax</a> talk which was a hit. My audience was just fantastic - they asked a ton of questions and I had a real blast with this talk. From the comments I got afterward it sounds like people learned a bunch and had a good time. Later that afternoon I gave <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=406">Deconstructing Prototype</a> for the first time and it went pretty well I think. Bill's Antipatterns talk was great; it just amazes me that some of his examples ever made it out to the real world and I applaud him for being able to turn a critical eye towards his <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">employer</a>. That afternoon I taped a short video on UI/JavaScript etc. that will someday find its way to the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">NFJS</a> site - I'll be sure to post when it goes up.

<a href="http://blog.jjg.net/">Jesse James Garrett</a>'s keynote was quite something; his slide deck was quite a work of art and had many of the speakers buzzing. He's clearly a believer in the <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lessig</a>/<a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/">Presentation Zen</a> method; the use of images and words plus the integration of blank screens was worth the price of admission. I also enjoyed the case study from the <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> folks; they've got some great examples of Ajax on their site but what I respect so much is their belief in testing. According to <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/sean_kane.html">Sean Kane</a>, about 70% of the features his team dreams up never make it out of testing!

During the second expert panel Scott threw out the "what books do you recommend" question and as usual <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a> stole two of mine (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDreaming-Code-Programmers-Transcendent-Software%2Fdp%2F1400082463%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1189881321%26sr%3D1-1&tag=ntschuttacom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Dreaming in Code</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ntschuttacom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and another that I'm surprisingly blanking on). Needless to say, I've got a few things to read in the coming months - here's a list of what I jotted down to follow up on:

While I really enjoyed the entire weekend, the highlight was <a href="http://www.humanized.com/">Aza Raskin</a>'s workshop on design. He discussed the "<a href="http://www.humanized.com/weblog/2006/09/11/monolog_boxes_and_transparent_messages/">monologue box</a>" (aka JS alerts) along with his solution of transparent messages. His examples of undo on the web were inspirational sparking a lot of discussion. Throughout his talk he showed off <a href="http://www.humanized.com/products/">Enso</a> and though I love <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> I wouldn't mind if Humanized ported that bad boy over to the Mac! Aza talked a lot about natural language which lead to the quote of the week:



<blockquote>Trying to remember the command for tar -gvf is like bobbing for apples in a cement mixer.
</blockquote>


Aza was good enough to join a handful of speakers at dinner after the show and he even tagged along for a couple of hours of pool. Good thing he and I are pretty close in skill at that particular game...though he did school me in air hockey.

Needless to say, it was a great evening and fantastic way to wrap up the conference. Neal and I did our best to recruit Aza for NFJS, he'd certainly be a welcome addition. Anyway, a great show and I'm really looking forward to next year when we'll have not one but two opportunities to get the web community together!
