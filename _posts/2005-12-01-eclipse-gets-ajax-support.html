As I've mentioned before, tool support for Ajax was coming and sure enough, this week Genuitec LLC announced <a href="http://www.myeclipseide.com/">MyEclipse Enterprise Workbench</a> 4.1 that includes support for developing Ajax based applications with JavaScript editing and debugging.  Its $49.95 per developer cost would be a real bargain just for the JavaScript piece but it also adds better UML capabilities and visual design tools for JSPs and JSF.  Check out this Computerworld piece: <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/developmenttopics/development/story/0,10801,106601,00.html?source=NLT_APP2&nid=106601">Eclipse developers to get AJAX access.</a>

Now, I've been a <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> guy since Ryan turned me on to the improvements made in 4.1 but I have to say: very cool stuff!  I think it's going to be immensely interesting to see what the next 6-12 months brings in the tool space.  While we spent a fair amount of time in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127567332/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a> <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/10/31/more-foundations-of-ajax/">discussing tools</a> to ease the pain of JavaScript development, seeing the mainstream IDEs starting to have built in support is a huge step forward.  In fairness to the guys at Sun, Tor Norbye has a great write-up about his <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/tor?entry=creator_and_ajax_the_demo">Creator and Ajax</a> demo at JavaOne and with Sun announcing that <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/07/21/HNstanford_1.html">all its software will be free</a> I can't help but wonder what that will mean for the NetBeans world.  Tor <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/tor?entry=clarifreecation">clarified what free meant</a> on his blog and frankly, I'm going to have to try it out!  And for those of you that are wondering what NetBeans is up to with JavaScript - <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen">Roumen</a> pointed me to this <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/servlets/BrowseList?list=nbdev&by=thread&from=278835">link</a>.
