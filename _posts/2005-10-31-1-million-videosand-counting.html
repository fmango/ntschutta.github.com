It always happens doesn't it?  You buy some new-fangled gadget and a week later out comes a cheaper, faster, bigger, prettier gadget.  Sigh.  Back in late August I broke down and <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/22/the-halo-effect/">bought an iPod</a> - mostly for our trip to Spain - and now we have <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html">video iPods</a>.  When I first heard rumors about watching a movie or TV show on an iPod, I had to admit I was skeptical.  Well, I guess I should know better than to do doubt - Apple has <a href="http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/cultofmac/index.blog?entry_id=1267111">sold more than a million videos</a> in less than 20 days despite a rather limited content.

I'm very interested to see how this experiment works especially as more shows and movies are added.  While I doubt I'll be buying one soon (maybe I can give "my" iPod to Christine and buy a newer, shinier video iPod...yeah, I doubt it) I have to admit, I would have watched an episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/">Lost</a> in Spain...
