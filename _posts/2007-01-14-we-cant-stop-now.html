title: We Can't Stop Now

We've all seen it. The shiny new system obviously won't solve the problem it was meant to yet the funding continues - in some cases it's even increased in a desperate effort to right the ship. Many excuses are offered but my personal favorite is the "we've already spent so much money - we can't stop now." As if throwing good money after bad is somehow a virtue.

I don't know about you, but I think it's pretty neat when two radically different bloggers comment on the same idea from different perspectives. Don't get me wrong, I expected a lot of commentary on the new <a title="iPhone" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> (yes, I want one) but last week both <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/Blog/Page.aspx?display=HotNeedleOfInquiry">Ron Jeffries</a> and the <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/">Freakonomics</a> folks struck the same cord: staying the course. Inspired by <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/iht/2007/01/13/world/IHT-13globalist.html">recent events in Iraq strategy</a>, Stephen Dubner compares Barack Obama's recent comments at a Senate hearing to behavioral economics and the <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2007/01/12/what-does-barack-obama-know-about-behavioral-economics/">sunk cost fallacy</a>. Jeffries goes a step further offering an explanation as to why leaders often prefer to <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/Blog/Page.aspx?display=StayTheCourse">stay the course</a>:
<blockquote>"Staying the course gives you a chance to be a winner, and leaves you no worse off than any other action, which guarantees you will be a loser."</blockquote>
Of course there is another reason why many managers can't bear to kill a project - that would be admitting they were wrong about something. When finally backed into a corner (or presented with overwhelming evidence) they are more likely to practice a little revisionist history than concede they were ever mistaken about a project. Maybe more projects need a <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/index.html">Zed Shaw</a> to do a little <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/essays/c2i2_hypothesis.html">analysis</a>! It may not be pleasant, but more often than not, the best outcome for a project can be an early death.
