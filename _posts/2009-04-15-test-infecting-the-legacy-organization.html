title: Test Infecting the Legacy Organization
type: post
published: true
---
As <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a> <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2009/04/real-world-refactoring-in-nfjs-magazine.html">explains</a>, the NFJS Anthology series has been reborn as a monthly magazine and in the current edition, you can read my take on test infecting legacy organizations. I've been a proponent of the testing meme for most of my career but I've also spent much of that time convincing reluctant coworkers (and managers) that testing was in their best interest - the article takes my talk of the same name and puts it to paper. All <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home.jsp">NFJS</a> attendees get a complimentary copy of of <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/magazine_subscribe.jsp">NFJS, the Magazine</a>, but anyone is free to <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/magazine_subscribe.jsp">subscribe</a>. Each month you'll get an eclectic mix of articles written by <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_list.jsp">NFJS speakers</a> on topics they are passionate about; if you'd like to see a sample article, check out <a href="http://agileartisans.com/main/blog/">Jared Richardson</a>'s <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/s/magazine/nfjs_the_magazine_sample_march2009.pdf">A Case for Continuous Integration</a> [PDF]. Enjoy!
