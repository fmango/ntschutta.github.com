It's a new year and that means more speaking (not that I haven't enjoyed the winter lull mind you!)  <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/12/30/code-freeze-2008/">Code Freeze</a> kicks the year off right and the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff</a> season is rounding into shape. In <a href="http://www.nejug.org/2008/Feb08.jsp">February</a>, I'm heading out to the Boston area to speak at one of the <a href="http://www.nejug.org/index.jsp">top JUGs</a> around. My friend <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/speaker/mark_richards.html">Mark Richards</a> used to run this group and based on what I've heard, it's a top notch collection of developers. I'll be giving one of my favorite talks, <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=594">Designing for Ajax</a>; if you're in the neighborhood, I hope to see you there!
