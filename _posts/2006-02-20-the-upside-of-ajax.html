Near as I can tell, none of the major Ajax sites have referenced <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a>'s piece entitled <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/14/AJAX-Performance">The Real AJAX Upside</a>.  Tim hits on some of my company's reasons for adding Ajax to our applications - it makes them perform better (or, more precisely, it looks to the customer like it does - waiting for a full page refresh just takes time).  While I fundamentally like the idea of pushing more work down to the client (kind of like <a href="http://www.seti.org/site/pp.asp?c=ktJ2J9MMIsE&b=179086">SETI</a>) we can't forget that the browser is not always the ideal environment for, you know, heavy duty XML processing.  I've been stressing the usability aspects of Ajax but maybe I need to push this comment:

<blockquote>Yeah, that cool, responsive AJAXy stuff is nice but maybe itâ€™s the icing on the cake; the real win is making the Web run faster.
</blockquote>

What do you think?  Should we pitch Ajax as a usability story or is it about performance?  Or is this just a classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win-win_game">win-win</a> situation?  Oh, and if you are trying to justify bringing Ajax into your application, check out <a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/andre/?p=52">Measuring the usability and business benefits of AJAX</a> and <a href="http://justaddwater.dk/2006/01/14/ajax-performance-stats-roi-and-business-value/">AJAX performance stats, ROI, and business value</a>.
