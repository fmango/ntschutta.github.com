I suspected this was coming when <a title="Charles Nutter's blog" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> started posting <a title="Eclipse to NetBeans" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/09/from-eclipse-to-netbeans-part-3.html">about NetBeans</a> but today it became official: the <a title="JRuby steps into the Sun" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/09/jruby-steps-into-sun.html">JRuby guys are now employees of Sun</a>!  It's been clear for a while now that Sun is really embracing dynamic languages (JavaOne was widely considered "<a title="JavaOne" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/10/reflections-on-javaone/">the one about scripting</a>") but this is quite a step.  Earlier, I talked about <a title="Rails and Java" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/08/29/rails-java/">Java and Rails</a> and this move by Sun further cements this stance in my mind.  I suspect this will have some interesting implications on the <a title="Enterprise Impasse" href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/09/01/enterprise-impasse">enterprise impasse</a>...

Anyway, congratulations to Charles (I'll repeat my plea to get some freakin sleep already) and <a title="Tom Enebo" href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/ThomasEEnebo">Tom </a>- best of luck you guys!  I just hope you remember us <a title="RUM" href="http://www.ruby.mn/">little people</a>...
