All right Joe, I said I'd have a list for you before I left...here you go.  And I'm not even going to give you my associate links!
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127565807/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a> - considering how much "<a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/">ajaxian</a>" techniques are used in ION, this is pretty useful.  Besides, I know the authors, I could probably get a copy signed for you ;)</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201310058/qid=1127565424/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Effective Java</a> by Joshua Bloch - must have, we've based a lot of the approached in ION off this book.  Seriously, anyone writing Java code should have this on their shelf.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596005407/qid=1127565496/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Head First Servlets and JSPs</a> - while technically not a "reference manual" it will help answer questions like what you IM-ed me with the other day.  Plus, read this, and I can pretty much guarantee you'll pass SCWCD.  Keep up with <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy's blog</a> too...its fantastic!</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596003161/qid=1127565608/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Guide</a> - there might actually be more up to date references but we used this and the next book extensively.  If the instructor from the JS class had better ideas, that's fine.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596000480/qid=1127565722/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</a> - again, there might be more recent books but this was also a staple.  I've heard good things about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764557432/qid=1127565777/sr=8-3/ref=pd_bbs_3/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">JavaScript Bible</a> as well.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201485672/ref=pd_sim_b_2/104-0760137-7376742?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance">Refactoring</a> by <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Fowler</a> - seriously, if it has Martin's name on it, just buy it!</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465067107/qid=1127565978/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Design of Everyday Things</a> - if you want to know <strong>*why*</strong> I did many of the things I did with the UI, here's the place to start.  And, you'll never look at doors the same way again...</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/020161622X/qid=1127566009/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> - a must read for anyone writing software as far as I'm concerned.  I followed <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/">Andy</a> and <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave's</a> principles throughout the application.</li>

</ul>

While I <strong>*love*</strong> books, I have to admit, a lot of what I'm learning these days comes from blogs.  While I've got a few of my favorites in my blog roll, it's not all inclusive.  When I get back we can touch base on blogs I find interesting!  Hope that gets you started...
