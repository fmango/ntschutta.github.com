<a title="Joel on Software" href="http://joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a> put out a flurry of posts in the last few days including this <a title="Travelers Insurance: Drop Dead." href="http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/07/29.html">interesting look</a> at a recent <a title="Travelers" href="http://www.travelers.com/">Travelers Insurance</a> ad that depicts geeks in a rather stereotypical light.  I'm guessing a lot of folks will agree with Joel's assessment that the add is offensive - what do you think?  All I know is it sounds like he's shopping for a new policy:
<blockquote>You probably forgot that most of the people that read Inc. are geeks. And we buy insurance. Lots of insurance. Like me. And in fact I used to buy it from you. But not any more.</blockquote>
Now, I have no idea just how many geeks are covered by Travelers, but I do know that a lot of them read Joel's blog...wonder how many will join him in his boycott?  Smacks a bit of Microsoft's recent <a title="Evolve" href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/evolve/default.mspx">evolve</a> campaign and we know how <a title="Terrible Lizard, Terrible Marketing" href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/03/terrible-lizard-terrible-marketing.html">popular</a> that <a title="BillG on Dinosaurs" href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/04/billg-on-dinosaurs.html">has been</a>!
