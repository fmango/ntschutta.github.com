With the third anniversary of our wedding coming up next week, I was struck by a phrase I heard while planning our nuptials: October is the New June.  We love the fall hence part of our attraction for the date but it was clear even then that more and more people were getting married as the leaves turned.  Well, last night, we celebrated the marriage of my good friend Christine (aka Elder) to long time beau Derek!  It was just an idyllic day - temps were in the mid 60s with a ton of sunshine - frankly the kind of day we had hoped for back in 2002.  Anyway, it was great to catch up with old friends like <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/27/weddings-are-beautiful/">Linnea, Curtis</a>, Althea, and Tom (Al and Tom are getting married next weekend - see, everyone wants a fall wedding but still, I like to think Christine and helped popularize the date!)  Elder was gorgeous and the <a href="http://www.womansclub.org/">Woman's Club of Minneapolis</a> is a great spot for a reception, great location, very intimate setting.  I'd never been a wedding at the <a href="http://www.mary.org">Basilica</a> but it was fantastic!
