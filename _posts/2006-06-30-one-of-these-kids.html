is doing his own thing.  A few months back, <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a> blogged about the books that are on her "<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/02/whats_on_your_v.html">virtual coffee table</a>".  Maybe this is obvious, but I'm an absolute sucker for books - in grade school, we'd order books from these little catalogs (I'm sure it was a fundraiser of some sort) and inevitably my parents would spring for more than a couple.  I have very found memories of "delivery day", walking up to the front of the room and taking my bushel of books back to my desk.  A couple of times I weaseled out of the annual holiday play just so I could read during the practice sessions and if you've ever seen my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F">Amazon</a> account or, well, walked through my house, you'd know I've still got a thing for books!

I'm also a fan of lists like <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a>'s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FogCreekMBACurriculum.html">management training program</a> or <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a>'s <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/04/my_ten_favorite.html">ten favorite books</a> (and you can see what <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/recent-reads/">I've been reading</a>...though it's a bit out of date and of course my proverbial <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/my-bookshelf/">book shelf</a>).  Anywho, the other night I looked over at my coffee table and saw this rather interesting collection of books (sorry it's a little blurry).

Ironically, I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0596100949%2Fqid%3D1151720737%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Beyond Java</a> at <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/10/reflections-on-javaone/">JavaOne</a> and, well, I think you'll see a trend here (as evidenced by <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/category/railsconf/">these entries</a> from RailsConf).  Can you tell which book stands out?  I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F032133678X%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1151720703%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8">Java Puzzlers</a> because I'm pretty sure anything by Bloch is worth reading (I cannot wait for the next edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201310058?v=glance%26n=283155%26s=books%26v=glance">Effective Java</a>) and, well, his <a href="http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/2006/coreplatform/TS-1188.html">talk at JavaOne</a> was darn interesting.  Anyway, I'm heavily influenced by guys like <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a>, <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/">Andy Hunt</a>, <a href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/">Justin Gehtland, Stuart Halloway</a>, <a href="http://clarkware.com/">Mike Clark</a> and several others (hmm, common theme - <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">NFJS</a>!) and given their propensity towards things other than Java I'm listening.  That's <strong>*not*</strong> to say I have anything against Java nor do I think Java is going away, in fact it bodes well that Sun is pushing hard into the <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net/">dynamic language world</a> (take a loot at <a href="https://phobos.dev.java.net/">Phobos</a>).  BTW, the other two books (as if you needed me to tell you) are <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> and <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_eir/index.html">Enterprise Integration with Ruby</a>.

Just as a golfer uses more than one club to play 18 holes, I think a competent developer should know more than one programming language.  Saying that I'm spending most of my spare time looking into alternatives to Java is simply a way for me to expand my mind.  I was a tad irritated by all the Java bashing last weekend but there is an awful lot the Java camp can learn from the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> guys (and vice versa I should add).  I don't know where Ruby or Rails breaks down yet, but I'm pretty darn interested in finding out...
