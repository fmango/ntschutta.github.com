Like many geeks I'm pretty sure <a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/">Dilbert</a> is just about the greatest comic ever (right up there with <a href="http://www.thefarside.com/">The Far Side</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a>) but today's <a href="http://www.comics.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2006114659027.gif">strip</a> just rang so true!  Of course <a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2006102104712.jpg">some</a> of these hit so close to home that it is just scary - seriously I think there are days that he's just down the hall.  And more than a couple of people found the <a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2002443261018.gif">latest</a> <a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2006101221621.gif">coffee</a> <a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2732970061023.gif">series</a> reminded them all too much of me...
