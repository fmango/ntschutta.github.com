OK, so maybe these observations are only interesting to me but what do you expect - it's Friday night and I'm siting in the middle of good old A concourse (as I've said <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/10/20/ah-travel/">before</a>, this traveling stuff is so very <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/02/08/random-travel-notes/">glamorous</a>). That's right, sometime early Saturday morning I should find myself in <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=94">Oklahoma</a> for the next <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff</a> event...and since I breezed through security, I've got some time to kill. Anyway, couple of things caught my attention this week.

Now, as anyone that knows will attest, you won't often find me at the gym blasting my quads. But occasionally guilt or some perverse sense of pride prods me into wandering in and breaking a sweat. Yesterday just happened to be one of those days and I couldn't help but notice the promotion the club was running (posters were everywhere...you couldn't avoid them). The idea was, refer 5 people and you get your name in a drawing. All right, that makes sense - drum up some leads from your current members. And the grand prize really was something though I suspect it might have a perverse affect on the member that won it, you see, they were giving away a Bow Flex, that king of infomercial hard bodies (something tells me they do a little more than 30 minutes 3 days a week - or perhaps they don't eat.) Maybe it's just me, but it seems somewhat counterintuitive for a health club to award a member something that, in theory, obviates the need for a membership. But I suppose you'd really just lose that one member...

Today at the airport something else stood out in my sleep deprived mind. If you've ever been as <a href="http://www.mspairport.com/msp/">MSP</a>, you know that A concourse is, well, nearly in Stillwater and the easiest way to get out there is on the tram. Like their weak cousins the moving walkway, trams area  staple at airports big and small and most seem to be operated without a human driver. That makes sense, it couldn't be <strong>*that*</strong> hard to program right? Anyway, it has been raining here in the big Minne and as I looked out the front of the car, I noticed a windshield wiper. Now, there's no driver...but we've got a windshield wiper. I appreciate the clear view of the track ahead but I can't help but wonder what purpose that serves. Do people somehow feel better knowing that the the window is free of precipitation? Could be.

Well, I suppose that's enough random chatter for now. By the time I post this I'll be begging for some espresso...and missing home.
