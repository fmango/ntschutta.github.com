Since I practically goaded <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn Vanderburg</a> into the conversation, I just have to point to a very insightful post he wrote entitled <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/Software/Development/building_bridges.rdoc">Bridges and Software</a>. In general I have a hard time wtih most of the comparisons of software - push comes to shove, software is like, well, software. It isn't a pure construction process but then little of what we create would be classified as art. That said, I tend to think ours is a craft more closely aligned with the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/articles/ArtInProgramming.pdf">later</a> than the former.

Anyway, I was particularly struck by the fact that Robert Maillart's bridges were originally derided while the "state of the art" produced one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge#First_bridge">most widely known engineering failures</a>. I can't help but think - what "truth" do we hold so dear today that will soon be considered folly (I'm hoping useless meetings and process definition teams)? What object or scorn today shall soon be seen as state of the art (please let it be <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/?p=89">offices</a> with flat panel monitors and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html">comfortable chairs</a>). Great post Glenn!
