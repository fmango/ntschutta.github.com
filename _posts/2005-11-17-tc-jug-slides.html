Last night Ryan and I spoke about Ajax at the <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JavaUserGroup.aspx">Twin Cities Java User Group</a>.  We had a great time - thanks to everyone that braved the cold we hope you'll take a look at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590595823/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&n=283155&s=books&v=glance&tagActionCode=ntschuttacom-20">Foundations of Ajax</a>!  <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Instructors/Default.aspx?InstructorID=6">Jeff Jensen</a> was a great host, we really appreciate the opportunity to present.  I felt bad for the book that no one wanted (and no, I won't tell you which book that was) and for the lucky folks that won our book - enjoy!

Anyway, people asked me to post the slides so here you go.  Enjoy!
