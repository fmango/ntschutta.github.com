A while back, I <a title="Playing by the Rules" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/10/playing-by-the-rules/">commented</a> on <a title="Warpspire" href="http://warpspire.com/">Kyle Neath</a>'s <a title="Jumping Ship" href="http://warpspire.com/journal/ia-usability/jumping-ship/">piece</a> regarding screen resolution.  Of course both of our posts went a bit beyond that, but it appears that we now have an answer from none less than <a title="Useit" href="http://www.useit.com/">Jakob Nielsen</a>.  In his latest <a title="Alertbox" href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/">Alertbox</a>, <a title="Screen Resolution" href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/screen_resolution.html">Screen Resolution and Page Layout</a>, Jakob tells us we are free to bump it up to 1024x768.  So there you go - don't say you never learned anything here!
