As expected, things went up a notch today - we pretty much did labs from dawn till dusk. I wouldn't say the fire hose was on full bore and there was only one lab that I didn't manage to finish but we definitely covered some ground. The class is still following AWR pretty closely but I do appreciate the little tips and tricks Mike and Dave share as they walk through the exercises. More impressive is the live coding - I realize I'll need to do more of this next year on the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">NFJS</a> tour but it never ceases to amaze me how much Rails does with so little code.

The concepts are definitely starting to sink in and certain aspects are becoming more normal to me. Still, there's a fair amount of magic..but I feel more prepared (and motivated) to dive into the source. <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Partials">Partials</a> seem like a great idea and the ability to pass a hash of parms into the constructor of an ActiveRecorder subclass is just brilliant. Seriously, so much of this stuff is so easy it just feels like stealing. And all the time I've spent building plumbing in Java...sigh. Oh and I'm still getting a kick out of the local weather guys and how they define cold - when I checked the weather back home this morning, it was 0 so these "lows" in the 20s just don't impress me.  Big chill indeed...bone chilling.  Yeah.

Tomorrow will be Ajax day plus the future of Rails - should be interesting!

<strong>Update:</strong> OK, so Joe and I went to get a cup of coffee this morning and I have to admit...with the windchill, it <strong>*was*</strong> pretty nippy. Not as cold as home but it got my attention.
