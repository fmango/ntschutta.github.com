I meant to post this earlier (I'm a little behind on my blogging) but...<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/pad/">Practices of an Agile Developer</a> (Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F097451408X%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1145126480%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">link</a>) is now availalbe!  For my take on PaD, see my <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/16/practices-of-an-agile-developer/">earlier post</a>, take a look at <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/articles/2006/04/10/practices-of-an-agile-developer-now-available">Andy's announcement</a> (looking forward to those podcasts Andy!) as well as <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,b43771a5-eb46-4f5b-a548-8357d9aa6b62.aspx">Venkat</a>'s.  This really is a fantastic book and I highly recommend it.  Congratulations to Andy and Venkat for writing such a great book!
