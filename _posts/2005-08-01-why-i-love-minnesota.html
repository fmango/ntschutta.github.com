I'm not sure why I feel compelled to write this, but its my blog and I'll do what I want to.  I've had plenty of people wonder, out loud, why I could possibly live in this (often) frozen state.  Of course I'm convinced many people think Minnesota has snow 9 months out of the year - and I tell ya, it just ain't so!

Anyway, this past weekend was filled with reminders of why I live here.  On Friday night, while my wife and I sat by the fire (yes, we roasted marshmallows and ate s'mores) one of the loons on our lake <a href="http://www.ns.ec.gc.ca/wildlife/loons/sounds/trem.wav">called out</a> to its mate.  For those of you that haven't heard a <a href="http://www.ns.ec.gc.ca/wildlife/loons/sounds/wail.au">loon call echo across a lake</a> in person, I'm not nearly the writer required to express the feelings that sound evokes.

On Saturday, my wife and I went fishing (hey, we are Minnesotans after all!) and twenty five feet of our bow, one of the loons was paddling along.  One hundred feet from the loon the eagle that calls our lake home was looking for a little breakfast.  That evening, the loon family floated just off our dock.

I'll admit there are days (OK weeks) in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/best/bplive/topten/coldest.html">January</a> and February where I really do question my sanity.  However, weekends like the last one in July remind me why I call this wonderful state home.  Besides, it really is nice to have <a href="http://education.umn.edu/MN/weather.html">four seasons</a>!  I mean how boring must San Diego be?
