On Monday, I <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/10/book-promotion/">posted</a> about the cool promotion on select <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a> and <a href="http://www.friendsofed.com/">Friend of Ed</a> books at <a href="http://www.bn.com/apress">Barnes and Noble</a>.  Well, I was just informed that, along with the great discount, you can win an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a>!  The details are <a href="http://www.apress.com/promo/bn/index.html">here</a> but the gist is this: take your picture at B&N in front of the display, send the pic in and you're entered in a drawing to win a 1 gig nano.  Remember, the cool kids will be reading Foundations of Ajax...  Good luck!
