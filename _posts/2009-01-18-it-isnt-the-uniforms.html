If you're a football fan (American style) this is a <a href="http://www.nfl.com/schedules#Week">big weekend</a> - the AFC and NFC championship pit (pun intended) a couple of six seeds vs. a two and a four respectively. Much will be made in the off-season of just how the Cardinals made a <a href="http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/22981870/">Giants like run</a> or how the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/peter_king/01/10/ravens.titans.insider/index.html">Ravens went so far with a rookie quarterback</a> and you can bet your morning mocha that a couple of hundred coaches will be dissecting everything the champions did to win today's games. Yes, <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/c/charlescal203963.html">imitation is the sincerest form of flattery</a> and many will attempt to copy the winning formula.

It isn't just sports franchises that imitate each other and raid the winner's coaching staff, no, companies do the same thing. From performing the same morale sapping rifs to utilizing the same bland beige decor, corporate entities love to ape one another. Even within an organization, the "successful*" (however that is defined) VPs will find their ways quickly copied.

While we should certainly ask ourselves what's working and what's not, we need to make sure we understand what actually is working. Take Arizona's success for instance. It may make sense to look at their offensive approach (as well as their coaching staff) to see what gems one might find. However, it takes a great deal of effort to find the golden nugget and most won't put in the time. No, many will take a shortcut and insist that the Cardinal's owe their Cinderella year to the color of their uniforms or the fact that Kurt Warner wears a glove on is throwing hand. Not only is the superficial easier to find, it is far easier to implement. Uniforms can be changed in a few days, establishing a winning tradition can take years.

In the technology space, it's tempting to just copy a specific technology stack and it's certainly easier to just buy the same vendor supplied vaporware than to hire better developers. But chances are you won't be capturing the true essence of their success, you'll just change the color of your uniforms.

So before you run off and decide that all new software in your organization should be written in that awesome new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_software_engineering">CASE tool</a> that's Bob's team uses, be sure that's the real secret sauce and not an ancillary fact. Odds are if you dig a little deeper you might find something else, something actually worth replicating.

* Unlike the sports world where a win is a win, success in the corporate world can be defined and then redefined especially when someone's bonus is involved. Worse, sometimes one area's success comes at the cost of the overall organization.
