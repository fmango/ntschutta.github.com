These days, everyone is busy. Sites like <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> have plenty of <a href="http://www.43folders.com/topics/productivity">posts</a> dedicated to ways to make you more <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/productivity/">productive</a>. And while <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">Getting Things Done</a> is certainly important, many have forgotten the importance of slack. We've all been given stretch goals but maybe that's <a href="http://blog.toolshed.com/2007/12/are-you-working.html">not the answer</a>. None other than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> recommends having spare capacity:



<blockquote>“You must always work not just within but below your means. If you can handle three elements, handle only two. If you can handle ten, then handle five. In that way the ones you do handle, you handle with more ease, more mastery and you create a feeling of strength in reserve.”
</blockquote>


I wonder what would happen if fewer of us were <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/so_it_takes_les.html">juggling multiple projects</a>, if instead we had some time to <a href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2008/01/_one_of_the_bro.html">let our minds wander</a>. Love him or hate him, Bill Gates is a darn smart dude and his contributions to technology can't be denied. Frankly, many of us could benefit from something akin to his <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB111196625830690477-IZjgYNklaB4o52sbHmIa62Im4.html">think weeks</a> though I'm sure few (if any) companies would ever sponsor such a thing for mere rank and file employees. Oh wait, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/static.py?page=about.html">Google</a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/googles-20-percent-time-in-action.html">does</a>.

Manufacturing plants don't constantly run their assembly lines at red line - to do so would cause costly breakdowns. Yet we're constantly rushing to fix bugs or slap in that much needed feature and right or wrong, some people (heck some entire companies) thrive on a heroic "fire fighting" approach. But repeated use of tactical solutions guarantees a heaping pile of technical debt. <a href="http://xprogramming.com/xpmag/jatSustainablePaceInSelfDefense.htm">Sustainable pace</a> is a key aspect of agile approaches to software and to quote Pat Parelli:



<blockquote>"Take the time it takes so it takes less time."</blockquote>



Sometimes that means taking time to think. Sometimes that means taking time for play or exercise. The next time you're given yet another high priority item at work, remember the value there is in slack...
