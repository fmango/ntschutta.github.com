Christine and I don't have children (yet) but whether you do or not, take a look at <a href="http://dearelena.wordpress.com/">Dear Elena</a>; I warn you, it'll <a href="http://dearelena.wordpress.com/2006/02/23/unfinished-business/">tug at your heart strings</a>.  For those of you with a young one or two around the house, take the advice of <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> and <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/23/Remembering-Elena">love</a> your <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/02/23#remberingElena">children</a>.  I'm not acquainted with Dear Elena's author but my heart goes out to him and his family - I hope that the blog will help you work through your grief; know that my wife and I will be keeping you in our hearts and prayers.  It's quite something to see the outpouring of support on the comments - people really are genuinely good.
