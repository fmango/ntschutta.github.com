Virtually everything I read these days comes from the web - beyond just a few parts of the Sunday paper, I get all my news from online sources.  I also read a ton of blogs and whatnot and while I don't mind reading short pieces on a screen at a certain point I just want a physical copy.

Most news sites get this and accordingly have a print button somewhere on the screen.  Lately I've been using aggregators like <a href="http://news.google.com/nwshp?hl=en&tab=wn&q=">Google News</a> so the articles I'm reading are coming from a variety of sources and inevitably I end up searching for a print button!  With all the design guidelines out there and the general commonalities on the web, why is there so much variety when it comes to print options?  Sometimes it's a link, other times a button.  I've seen the link/button at the bottom of a story, the top, the left, the right...I mean come on, can't we all just agree on an approach here?  I know that the actual formating of the page for printing can be tricky but can't we at least come to a consensus for <strong>*where*</strong> to find the darn thing?

I can understand (somewhat) that different sites act differently, but what about good old <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a>?  If you go to a normal news story - say this one about <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/12/07/katrina.fund/index.html">Katrina relief</a>, you'll find PRINT THIS at the bottom of the story.  However, if you venture over to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/">CNNMoney</a> - say this article about <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/12/07/pf/taxes/house_amt/index.htm">AMT relief</a>, you see PRINT at the top of the story.  Sigh.  They don't look the same, heck they aren't even named the same...  Honestly, do news sites actually think people only use one source?

Here are just a few different print options:
<ol>
<ul>
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a>:
<ol>
<ul><img src="/images/cnn.png" alt="CNN's print button" /></ul>
</ol>
</ul>

<ul>
<a href="http://money.cnn.com/index.html">CNNMoney</a>:
<ol>
<ul><img src="/images/cnn_mon.png" alt="CNN Money's print button" /></ul>
</ol>
</ul>

<ul>
<a href="http://www.startribune.com/">StarTribune</a>:
<ol>
<ul><img src="/images/star_trib.png" alt="StarTribune's print button" /></ul>
</ol>
</ul>

<ul>
<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/">SFGate</a>:
<ol>
<ul><img src="/images/sfgate.png" alt="SFGate's print button" /></ul>
</ol>
</ul>

<ul>
<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/">MSNBC</a>:
<ol>
<ul><img src="/images/msnbc.png" alt="MSNBC's print button" /></ul>
</ol>
</ul>

</ol>


Maybe I missed it, but have <a href="http://www.uie.com/">any</a> of the <a href="http://www.useit.com/">usability</a> <a href="http://www.asktog.com/">guys</a> provided some thoughts on this?  Is it just me, am I just getting cranky?  And don't get me started on pages that don't even have a Print button...oh wait, my site doesn't!
