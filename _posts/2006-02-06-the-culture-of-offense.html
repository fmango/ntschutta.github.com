<a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2006/02/05/the-radical-culture-of-offense/">This piece</a> over on the <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/">BuzzMachine</a> sure has gotten a lot of responses.  Hey, I don't like it when people in foreign countries burn the American flag but I'm not throwing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail">Molotov cocktails</a> at their embassies either.  Seriously, take a deep breath already, it's a comic - I don't know about you, but I'm more interested in reading them now (reminds me of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ">protests</a> over <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095497/">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>).
