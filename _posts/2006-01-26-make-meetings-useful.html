I've commented <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/18/you-have-11-minutes/">once</a> or <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/15/meetings-are-like-goldfish/">twice</a> on meetings - and I'm not alone.  The folks over at <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a> have commented yet again with <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/you_still_want_meetings_heres_how_to_make_them_useful.php">tips on making them useful</a>.  I'm certainly not against meetings - they have their place.  However, I've been in far too many meetings that were a) far too long, b) had no agenda and c) involved FAR too many people.  Sometimes meetings need to involve a large cross section of the population of Cleveland...but not very often.  And what's the deal with meetings that don't result in action items?  I mean, c'mon, if we just spent the last 60 minutes discussing today's great problem, there aught to be some action items (just not for me).  Sigh.  It could be worse, I could be a manager.
