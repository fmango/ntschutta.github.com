Just a quick note to say I'll be speaking at <a href="http://www.qconlondon.com/">QCon London</a> in March - I'll be giving a talk on <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/speaker/Nate+Schutta">DSLs in JavaScript</a>. Looking at the <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/schedule/wednesday.jsp">schedule</a>, it should be a heck of a show and I'm really looking forward to spending some quality time in London! Oh, I have a discount code if you're interested in attending...
