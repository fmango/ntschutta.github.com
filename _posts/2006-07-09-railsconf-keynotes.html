Just wanted to point out that the <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/pages/rails/">RailsConf keynotes</a> are starting to appear on <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/">ScribeMedia</a>.  So far it's just <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/06/30/railsconf-2006-keynote-series-dave-thomas">Dave Thomas</a> and <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/07/03/martin-fowler-railsconf-2006-keynote-address">Martin Fowler</a> but I suspect the others will follow along shortly.  All the talks were great but regardless of your interest in Rails I recommend you listen to Martin, Paul Graham, and Nathaniel Talbott.  I first saw this on <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Fowler's blog</a>.
