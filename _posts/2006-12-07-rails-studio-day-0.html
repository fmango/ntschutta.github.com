I've been a big fan of the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Prags</a> since I read their first book <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">The Pragmatic Programmer </a>so when they started up the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/index.html">Pragmatic Studio</a> earlier this year I knew I'd have to partake. As soon as I saw the December show in Atlanta, I pulled the trigger! I did contemplate switching to the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails/locations.html#MN">Twin Cities</a> show - but going to the ATL actually saves me travel time (seriously) and gives me an excuse to hang around with an old friend. The trip down was pretty easy though the woman in the seat next to me clearly was uneasy about flying...and it rubbed off on me.  I've never been too anxious about flying (I understand the odds) but sure felt like I was channeling some of her emotions.

Let's see, what else. For the first time ever I took a cab to the airport - that was interesting. I'm used to taking cabs/shuttles once I <strong>*arrive*</strong> but this was new. My cabbie was a transplant from the Bay area so we discussed the futility that is being a <a href="http://www.raiders.com/intro/splash.html">football</a> fan... The flight was uneventful (yeah). I was pretty amazed at how large <a href="http://www.atlanta-airport.com/">Atlanta International</a> is (next time I'm going to take the tram) and the hotel is fine - huge though. The weather is "cold" by Georgia standards (I loved the comment this morning on the news: "pipes could freeze and bring in the pets") but for Joe and I it's quite pleasant. Heck, back home we're seeing highs in the single digits - here they complain about getting into the teens...for the morning low.  Yeah.  Tomorrow (well this will be in the past by the time I post) should be great - I'm really looking forward to immersing myself in Rails for three days!
