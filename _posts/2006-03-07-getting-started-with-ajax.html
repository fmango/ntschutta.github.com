I've been a fan of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> for some time now and I get really excited when my blog reader says they've posted something new.  Today they covered a topic near and dear to my heart with a piece entitled <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/gettingstartedwithajax">Getting Started with Ajax</a> which does a great job of covering the basics.  Of course I was particularly pleased to see that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&#038;s=books">Foundations of Ajax</a> was listed in the Ajax Resources section!  I know this may seem a bit biased, but if you're a web designer and you don't <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/feed/">subscribe</a> to ALA, you really should (and if you don't...well, you're in the minority - A List Apart is <a href="http://www.technorati.com/pop/blogs/">22</a> on <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>).
