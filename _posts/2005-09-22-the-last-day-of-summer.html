In my mind, the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/28/the-state-fair/">State Fair</a> truly marks the end of summer, but yesterday was officially the end.  Well, fall officially started <a href="http://www.factmonster.com/spot/equinox1.html">just a few minutes ago</a> but for those of you that think good old MN is frozen, we nearly hit 90 yesterday.  What a wild ride last-night's storms were - I hope all in the local viewing area came through OK...  In light of <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=Katrina&btnG=Search+News">Katrina</a> (soon to be joined by <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=Rita&btnG=Search+News">Rita</a>) it's really minor but still, enough to cause problems.  My old HS was shut down as was my parents' district and talking to my (new) coworkers, some folks had quite a bit of damage.  We had nearly 2.5 inches of rain here but luckily no damage.  Sigh.  Today was one of those "ideal fall days."  Shorts and a sweatshirt in the morning (and yes, I can actually wear shorts to the office now!) by the afternoon, <a href="http://kare11.com/weather/default.aspx">a cool dry 67 degrees</a> right now!
