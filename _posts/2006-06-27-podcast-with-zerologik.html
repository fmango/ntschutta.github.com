While I was in Chicago, Ryan and I did a podcast with the lads from <a href="http://www.zerologik.com/">ZeroLogik</a>.  We had a fantastic time chatting about a <strong>*wide*</strong> variety of topics (seriously Shane if you ever find yourself in need of another voice, just let me know).  I want to thank Shane and the rest of the lads for all their patience - we've been trying to get together with them for a while now.  One night we mixed up the time shift, another night Ryan didn't have power and we were supposed to talk last Wednesday but the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/21/flying/">travel gods conspired against me</a>.  Anyway, we finally got everyone online at the same time last Thursday <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/22/rails-guidebook/">after the guidebook</a> and all is well!

I haven't had a chance to listen all the way through but I have to say the hotel wi-fi was a little, well, spotty so on more than a few occasions I wasn't always sure what had been said - or even if my words got through (though that really doesn't sound like me)!  I'll warn you right now, ZeroLogik carries the explicit tag in iTunes...  Here's a link to <a href="http://www.zerologik.com/2006/06/zerologik_026_06222006.php">their blog</a> and the <a href="http://zerologik.com/episodes/ZeroLogik_Episode_26_20060622.mp3">mp3</a>.
