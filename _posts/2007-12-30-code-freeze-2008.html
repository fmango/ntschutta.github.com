In case you're looking for a great one day software symposium, <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/">UMSEC</a> will once again be hosting <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze_08/">Code Freeze</a> January 17th from 8 to 5 at the McNamara Alumni Center. The price is right especially if you're a <a href="http://www.msse.umn.edu/">MSSE</a> alum. Our topic is innovation and we've got a great lineup of speakers (if I do say so myself) - hope to see you there!
