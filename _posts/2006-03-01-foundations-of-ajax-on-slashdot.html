Ryan and I were quite thrilled to see that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&s=books">Foundations of Ajax</a> was <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdotted</a> today - <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/books/06/03/01/1356241.shtml">here's a link</a>.  <a href="http://decafbad.net/">Craig Maloney</a> gives us an 8 out of 10 (by the way, I loved your post on Michigan drivers...sad to say you could substitute Minnesota and it'd fit perfectly!) and there were some positive reviews within the comments as well.  Needless to say, we've spiked a tad on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&s=books">Amazon</a>...  Tip of the cap to <a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/blogs/brentashley/">Brent Ashley</a> for being the first to fill me in (hey, I was at lunch with the lads when it was posted) and thanks to those that emailed me - I appreciate the kind words!  I'm just tickled that our little book made it to the front page on Joe's customized Google home page ;)
