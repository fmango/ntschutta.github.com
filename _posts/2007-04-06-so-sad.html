I was very saddened to read <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/04/my_favorite_gra.html">this</a> today on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a>'s blog:



<blockquote>This will be the last post here quite some time, until I figure out what to do next.</blockquote>

 

While I completely <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/03/27/be-nice/">understand</a> where she's coming from, I will <strong>*greatly*</strong> miss her voice in the blogosphere. My day was always a bit brighter when my aggregator showed there was something new on Creating Passionate Users and I for one hope that Kathy quickly finds a way to continue spreading her message in a way that she's comfortable with. I further regret never having seen her present live - I'll just have to settle for the podcasts. It is so very sad that some incredibly small people were able to distinguish a light so bright. Here's to you Kathy, you will be missed.
