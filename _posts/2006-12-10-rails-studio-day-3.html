Well, we ended with a bang!  The morning started off with an Ajax lab (right up my alley) and I just have to say...Rails makes Ajax about as easy as it gets (hmm, I'm sensing a theme here).  I especially like the fact that I can quickly get an app working, add in Ajax, and (with almost zero effort) have a degradable system.  Oh, and <a href="http://www.rubynoob.com/articles/2006/05/13/simple-rails-rjs-tutorial">RJS</a> is just slick though it did make me question my opinions of <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a>.  Unlike a couple of my coworkers, GWT doesn't make me swoon - don't get me wrong, I think it's neat as all get out I'm just not ready to jump on the bandwagon.  But after playing around with RJS I might have to reconsider.

Most of today was a blur - we covered a lot of topics at a mile a minute.  I think <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/10/2/under-the-hood-rails-routing-dsl">routes</a> (especially named routes) are extremely cool and considering my new role at work the support for testing is just top notch.  I asked a few questions about test infecting organizations and I've got some great notes about testing in general.  The rest of the day included talk of <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">REST</a>, hooks and filters and caching finishing off with a discussion on deployment.

All in all I was quite happy with the training.  A faster pace would have been good, perhaps a few more labs, but there is a limit to what can be covered in three days with a mixed audience.  I suspect the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/railsadvanced/index.html">Advanced Studio</a> would be fantastic and I'm really thinking a <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/index.html">Rails Edge</a> would be useful (perhaps more so than <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">Rails Conf</a>...but that'll be a tough call).  I'm happy to call myself an alumni of the Studio - as expected Mike and Dave are great - if you need Rails training, I'd highly recommend <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Prag Studio</a>!
