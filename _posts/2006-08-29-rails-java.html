I've been singing the Rails front end/Java back end tune for quite a while now, especially after observing the changes in store for Java in the next year combined with the maturation of <a title="JRuby on codehaus" href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a>.  So, when I saw <a title="Rails Talk thread on Rails plus Java with JRuby" href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/508c6b7d2944d295">this post</a> come across the <a title="Rails talk list" href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk">Rails list</a> last week, it really caught my eye.  <a title="Charles Nutter Blog" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> hits the nail on the head:
<blockquote>I have also been disappointed with most of the Java-based web frameworks, almost entirely due to their over-heavy, over-complicated approaches to implementing the view and controller portions of an app. If I were to write an application now, I would give strong consideration to something more Railsy, even if it were backed by Java-based services.</blockquote>
As much as I do like Java (really, I still do!) using it to write web apps is jut plain painful.  That said, companies will be loathe to dump the massive investments they've made in Java over the last decade and rightfully so - but that doesn't mean we can't get the best of both worlds.  Imagine the speed of development inherent in the <a title="RoR" href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> world combined with the mature infrastructure of Java.  Sure seems to me like we'll be doing lots of this over the next few years...

BTW, <a title="Obie's blog" href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie">Obie Fernandez</a> posted about this <a title="Obie's post about Uncle Bob and Ruby" href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie?entry=uncle_bob_on_ruby_and">today</a> (though I've been happily reading along with the earlier posts) but did you happen to notice that <a title="But Uncle Bob" href="http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob">Uncle Bob</a> has been getting into Ruby and Rails lately?
