This week I'll heading down to St. Louis to <a href="http://www.gatewayjug.org/meetings/meeting.htm">speak</a> at the <a href="http://www.gatewayjug.org/index.htm">Gateway JUG</a> care of the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> tour. I've heard great things about the group and I'm really looking forward to the trip!
