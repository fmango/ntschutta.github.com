I'm fairly confident that many of my readers are also on my qotd (quote of the day) list (and if you're not, but would like to be, just drop me a note or post a comment) so you know how much I dig quotes.  Needless to say, <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/index.jsp">NFJS</a> has provided a number of interesting quips - here are some highlights.  These are mostly accurate though I wouldn't swear on a Bible that they are verbatim.

<em>Proof that JavaScript (and dynamic languages in general) are finally starting to be treated as first class citizens...</em>  Overhead in the (rather inadequate) restrooms.
<blockquote>"Two years ago, if you'd have told me that I'd give up a weekend and spend $600 to learn JavaScript, I'd have laughed at you."
</blockquote>

<em>The first one's free...</em>  <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs">Justin Gehtland</a> in the Spring/AOP "birds of a feather" session.
<blockquote>"Spring is the free vial of crack [for Aspect Oriented Programming]...next thing you know, you're mainlining the stuff."
</blockquote>

<em>Compiler?  I don't need no stinking compiler...</em>  Mr. Gehtland again (though he may have been quoting someone else).
<blockquote>"In two years, we'll all look at compilers like slow, broken unit tests."</blockquote>

That's all for tonight...must rest up for the last day!
