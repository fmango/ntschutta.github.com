I remember the first time I flew for business - I was working for a small consulting company and I was heading to Chicago for a few days of training. I was pretty excited to be on the road (and on expense account) but I was more than a little paranoid about loosing my laptop. Turns out I was right be be concerned: <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/07/hundreds_of_tho.html">nearly a quarter million go missing each year</a>. I've been traveling more then last couple of years but there's still a little gulp when I put my silver beauty on the old conveyor belt - so far so good (knock on wood) but I just hate having to take my laptop out of my bag along with my <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/on_the_implausi.html">oh so dangerous liquids</a>.

Driving home from Fourth of July fireworks, MPR had a blurb on this topic (<a href="http://www.publicradio.org/columns/futuretense/">Future Tense</a> has a wrap up in <a href="http://www.publicradio.org/columns/futuretense/2008/07/03.shtml#019185">this podcast</a>.) The TSA is proposing the <a href="http://gsnmagazine.com/cms/features/news-analysis/542.html">ultimate laptop bag</a> though the <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/tsas_ideal_lapt.html">usefulness to travelers is questionable</a>. I doubt I'd purchase one but I have admit, it would ease my mind if I didn't have to pull my MacBook Pro out of its safe, snug little case each time I went through security...
