Well, today was a pretty strange day.  After more than four years, most on the same team, I've moved on to a new employer.  Now, this isn't quite the same as <a href="http://www.karmacrash.com/articles/2005/08/24/love-it-or-leave-it-indeed">moving to Brazil</a>, but for me, this was no small decision.  Frankly, I first started thinking about this when I read Steve Jobs' <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">Commencement address at Stanford</a> this past year.  Of course it's really easy to do what you love when you've got Steve's bank account, but still, it's good advice.  I was especially touched by his thoughts on connecting the dots but I also liked this quote:



<blockquote>When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."  It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"  And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</blockquote>



As much as I've enjoyed my time at my now former employer, I have to admit, I've been saying "No" for too many days so when my friend Jen dropped me a line about an opening on her team, I was all too ready to see where it went.  While it is very hard to say goodbye to so many good friends, having been <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/31/farewell-casey-farewell/">preceded by others</a> makes it easier.  Still, it was hard to close this chapter in my life.

Besides being one in a line of people that have left, the "blogsphere" has certainly helped me come to terms with this transition.  Chad Fowler wrote a great piece entitled <a href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/LoveItOrLeaveIt.rdoc,v">Love it or Leave it</a>.   He has a <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/AnotherLoveItOrLeaveIt.rdoc,v">follow on piece</a> that lead me to another great read by Kathy Sierra entitled <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/01/you_20.html">You 2.0</a> (seriously, if you're not tracking <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a>, you should be.)  Now, I'm not moving to Denver (though I hear its beautiful) and I'll still be working in Java (though I would love to work on <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>!) but for me this really is a shift.  You see for years, I've worked on "business apps."  Most of what I've done revolves around building some custom software for a specific business function of a company.  Though I've consulted, I've always been a hired hand (in some cases viewed as little more than an expensive typist.)

But that all changes next week.  Next week I write a new chapter in my life - I see what its like to work at a software shop.  No, its not Google or Microsoft (or even Sun) but it is a real live software company here in the Twin Cities!  I actually know a surprising number of people where I'm going so I think I know what I'm getting into - obviously I'll keep you posted here.  I'm nervous, I'm a little scared, but I'm also really excited to see what this new opportunity brings.  To all of you that have offered me your thoughts in the last couple of months I extend my gratitude - you really helped!

I'm going to throw out one more quote (apologies to my qotd readers.)



<blockquote>Don't cry because it's over.  Smile because it happened.
	Dr. Seuss</blockquote>
