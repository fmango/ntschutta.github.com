I meant to mention this a bit earlier...but a few weeks back, Ryan and I recorded a podcast with <a href="http://fosterburgess.com/wp/">Mike Kimsal</a> over at <a href="http://www.webdevradio.com/index.php">WebDevRadio</a> and it is available <a href="http://www.webdevradio.com/index.php?id=34">here</a>.  The sound quality is pretty good (at least we sound more normal than the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/?p=98">talk we gave at UWL</a>!) and we had a great conversation on how we got into this, our background, why the server code is always in Java, the challenges in the Ajax space, etc.  The entire interview is a bit over an hour - many thanks to Mike for interviewing us, it was a blast!
