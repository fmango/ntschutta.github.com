Happy Birthday Christine!  Today my lovely wife officially gets a year older and the way she was talking after last weekend's painting adventure I think she's starting to feel a tad more senior too ;)  Last night we had a fantastic party at casa de Schutta - it was a blast!  The usual suspects were here: <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10042">my coauthor</a> Ryan along with his wife and son.  They were kind enough to pick up Christine's good friend Angie from the airport (she's visiting from 'Bama and is still sleeping in our guest bedroom right now.)  Speaking of good friends, one of the several Christines in our life was also here last night having recently returned to the Twin Cities from exotic <a href="http://ci.sheboygan.wi.us/">Sheboygan WI</a>.  I know what you're thinking but it actually is quite a great little town located not too far from <a href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Kohler-Wisconsin.html">Kohler</a>, home of <a href="http://www.destinationkohler.com/ws/ws.html">Whistling Straits</a> host of the 2004 PGA Championship and is, in my humble opinion, one of the best courses on the planet.  They also have some great restaurants - I highly recommend <a href="http://www.crwmag.com/Wistrails/DisWis/Sheboygan1.html">Trattoria Stefano</a> and <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/searchenginedetails/19276.html">Il Ritrovo</a>.

Of course my favorite in-laws were here early helping us get ready.  Special thanks to Gayle for helping me prepare on Friday!  Our favorite "aunt" Lynn was in attendance (tell JP we're sorry he couldn't make it) along with her daughter Sarah and her husband Mike (Ryan and I enjoyed trouncing you and Mitch on the <a href="http://www.worldbocce.org/">bocce ball</a> pitch!)  My good friend Adam came with his lovely wife Holly and family friends Gaynell and Michael were also here.  OK, I'm pretty sure that was everyone!  My folks were at a wedding otherwise they would have joined us.  Anyway, we had a great time, stayed up <strong>WAY</strong> too late talking with Angie and we ate <strong>WAY</strong> too much food!  It's times like yesterday afternoon/evening that I feel really blessed to have so many great people in our life!
