One of the hard and fast rules of web design has long been "thou shall develop for a screen resolution of 800x600."  Of course with monitors getting larger and larger (heck, this aging PowerBook runs at 1280x854) this maxim might be past it's prime.  So what's a designer to do?  Kyle Neath of <a href="http://warpspire.com/">Warpspire</a> takes a look at this question in his post <a href="http://warpspire.com/journal/ia-usability/jumping-ship/">Jumping Ship</a>.  Basically, Kyle channels <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a> (check out her <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/07/safe_is_risky_r.html">Safe is risky, risky is safe</a>) and, well, <a href="http://blog.talbott.ws/">Nathaniel Talbott</a>'s <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/09/railsconf-keynotes/">keynote from RailsConf</a> (check ScribeMedia <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/pages/rails/">for a link</a> to his talk).  While designing for the lowest common denominator can attract a large pool of customers, taking some risks opens you up to a batch of new ones.

I think Kyle hit's it on the head when he says 

<blockquote>"Making your users feel special is worth more than any advertisement could possibly cost."</blockquote>

Sure, you can play it safe, follow the well beaten path, but will that inspire <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/07/how_your_produc.html">The Nod</a>?  Of course it takes courage - it's not easy to try something different; while no one brags about their <a href="http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/2007/camry/">Camry</a>, Toyota sells a ton of them.

So what is a designer to do?  I'm with Kyle, give it a go!  If no one pushes the boundaries, we don't advance the field...
