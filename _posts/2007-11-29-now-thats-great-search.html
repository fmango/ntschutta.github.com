So, the project name is PAW which apparently has something to do with Bears... I'm not really sure what it means to Build Direct but I'm in favor of Bear Stores. Though how that relates to resumes, cars, biker build offs and homes, well, I'll just never know. At least <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/helpandsupport/learnmore/crawford_september03.mspx">Rover</a> was smart enough to stay in his house.
