I meant to post this over the weekend but alas, time was not on my side (I mean, hey, there was <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/peter_king/01/16/mmqb.real/index.html">some great playoff football</a> on!)  Anyway, <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/">Code Freeze</a> was a smashing success - we had somewhere around 220 people attend and most stayed for the entire day.  Thanks to everyone that came!  I had a great time, the <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/">UMSEC</a> folks took really good care of us, and I really enjoyed meeting all of the speakers.  And I've got lots of material for blog...now I just need the time.  Sigh.  There were some excellent talks and I'm expecting next year's event to be bigger and better so if you missed this go round, be on the look out for it in the fall!

My <a href="/slides/Ajax and the Enterprise.pdf">paper</a> was enclosed in the proceedings but my <a href="/slides/Ajax and the Enterprise Slides.pdf">slides</a> weren't so here those are.  I was also asked for a <a href="/slides/code freeze links.rtf">clickable copy of the footnotes</a> so I've added that as well.
