You'd think after the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/14/sony-anticustomer-te.html">hubbub</a> over Sony's <a href="http://">rootkit</a> problems of 2005, companies would know better but apparently Sears has decided that "community participation" has a <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/01/is_sears_engagi.html">very special meaning</a>. I have no idea how any company could possibly think this was a good idea... BTW, if you're not reading <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/">Schneier on Security</a> you're really missing out.
