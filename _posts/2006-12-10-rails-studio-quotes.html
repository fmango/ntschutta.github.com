So, people that know me realize I have a thing for quotes (see those from <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/02/railsconf-quotes/">RailsConf</a> as well as <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/18/nfjs-quotes/">NFJS local edition</a>). While there weren't a ton of memorable quips from my recent experience at <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic Studio</a> (see <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/12/07/rails-studio-day-0/">Day 0</a>, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/12/07/rails-studio-day-1/">Day 1</a>, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/12/08/rails-studio-day-2/">Day 2</a> and <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/12/10/rails-studio-day-3/">Day 3</a>) there were a couple that I had to share.  Again these are largely paraphrases but I think I've captured the gist.

This exchange occurred when I asked Mike how he was "hiding" his Keynote deck while in play mode (i.e., switching back to the desktop without hitting escape):
<blockquote>Mike: "Just hit H - one of the things Dave taught me."

me: "The list would be long"

Mike: "The things I learned from Dave... "

Dave: "A through H - that was H."</blockquote>
After trying app.methods in script console...  Mike said:
<blockquote>"Try app.taguri..oh wait, that's just missing the underscore, should be tag_uri, I thought that was something to do with Sushi, never mind."</blockquote>
That's not to say there weren't other interesting moments during the class ;)...but those were the ones I felt like sharing!
