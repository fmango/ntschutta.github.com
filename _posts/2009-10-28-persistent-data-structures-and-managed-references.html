Speaking of <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2009/10/13/dsls-in-javascript-video/">interesting videos</a>, <a href="http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/">Stuart Halloway</a> has been beating the drum pretty hard for <a href="http://clojure.org/">Rich Hickey</a>'s talk: <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Identity-State-Rich-Hickey">Persistent Data Structures and Managed References</a>. I was actually in the audience (along with <a href="http://http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn Vanderburg</a>) when Rich gave this talk at <a href="http://qconlondon.com/">QCon London</a> and I concur with Stu - this is something you're going to want to watch. A couple of times. Then watch it again. You'll thank me (and Stu) later. Oh, and you really should go to QCon. I mean it, it's a great show with some unique talks.
