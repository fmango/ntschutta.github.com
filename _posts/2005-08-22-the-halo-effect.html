Many have claimed that Apple's <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=aapl">recent stock performance</a> is largely due to the amazing popularity of their ubiquitous <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/70803/wo/nb3FpVfjU6z32DW3uIQAcpRYYqO/0.0.11.1.0.6.15.0.1.1.3.0.1.1.1.1.0">iPods</a> and the "<a href="http://www.macobserver.com/article/2004/11/24.3.shtml">Halo Effect</a>" this is having as <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/business/20050504-085829-1155r.htm">people purchase Macs</a> to go with their music players.  I'm no economist but I should have known something was up when my dad bought himself an iPod a couple of Christmases ago (oh if I would have picked up some Apple shares then!)  I held out - sure, iPods are trendy and lots of my friends have them but I just didn't listen to enough music to justify the cost.  Well, today I broke down and joined the masses.

<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/08/an_ipod_sheep_f.html">Am I a sheep</a>?  I don't think so, but I'm happy to be in the flock as it were.  If there is such a thing as the "Halo Effect" I think I'm part of it but not in the way you would expect.  You see, a few months back I bought a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html">15" PowerBook</a>.  I'll write more about why I switched soon but frankly, that purchase spurred me on to get an iPod.  I suppose that's backwards, but then most of the things I do are!

Of course the "real" reason I bought an iPod had to do with photos (I bought a <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/72601/wo/U86P8lFCrtHY3cMOcznBI47ZJYr/2.0.0.11.1.0.6.9.1.1.1.1.2.0.0.1.0">20 GB</a> now that they are all color) more specifically our upcoming trip to Spain.  While I have a 512 MB chip for our nifty digital camera, I didn't want to deal with deleting photos or shooting at lower resolutions.  Sure, I could have just purchased more memory cards but what fun would that be?  Anyway, I'll let you (yes, all two of you) know what I think as I start to play with this new toy but so far so good!  That said, the ear buds aren't so great - if you have any advice on good replacements (that don't cost more than the iPod itself) I'm all ears!
