I'm excited to announce a fantastic promotion from Barnes and Noble - from today until the 9th of August, you can get a heck of a deal (a 40% discount!) on Foundations of Ajax and a host of other great books from Apress.  The promotional price is good online (via <a href="http://www.bn.com/apress">this link</a>) and in physical stores.  So, if you haven't picked up a copy of our book, now you really don't have an excuse!
