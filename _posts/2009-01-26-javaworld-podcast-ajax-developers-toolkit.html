A recent chat with my good friend <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/">Andy Glover</a> (of "Jolt award finalist" <a href="http://easyb.org/">easyb</a> fame) has found it's way up on <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/podcasts/jtech/">JavaWorld's podcast</a> page. Andy has a <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/2009/01/25/ajax-chalk-talk-with-nate-shutta/">good overview of our conversation</a> over on the Disco Blog. I had a blast covering a topic near and dear to my heart - <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/podcasts/jtech/2009/011209jtech.html">have a listen</a>!
