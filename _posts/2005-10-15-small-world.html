Sorry for the pronounced silence, Christine and I spent a couple of weeks in Spain so between jet lag, sorting pictures, and a mountain of email, I'm a little behind!  Anyway, I was catching up on some of my blog reading when I stumbled on <a href="http://mcslp.com/?p=131">this piece</a> by <a href="http://mcslp.com/">MC Brown</a>.  Nathan Good was instrumental in getting me started in writing and he's one of the guys I really miss from my old stomping grounds.  Of course MC wrote the tutorials <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/07/27/improved-application-development-part-2-developing-solutions-with-rational-application-developer/">surrounding</a> <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/07/27/improved-application-development-part-2-developing-solutions-with-rational-application-developer/">mine</a> and I've really appreciated his advice.  Anyway, I just thought it was pretty cool that MC reviewed a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/159059441X/qid=1129397898/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">great book</a> by a good friend!
