From the "Only in Minnesota" file, the iPod is apparently a must have ice fishing tool.  Now I admit, I've never ice fished - I enjoy catch and release in the summer...when it's warm...but the idea of sitting out in 10 degree weather dropping a line into a hole...  Sorry, I just don't have the patience for it though as evidence by the hundreds of fish houses I see on area lakes lots of folks clearly do.  Of course I've heard of people who have fish houses that are more comfortable than their actual homes - most (if not all) are heated and it's not uncommon to have microwaves, pizza ovens, TVs...even satellite dishes.  I suppose if I was fishing from a couch while watching the game maybe I could be talked into it!

Anyway, I just had to post a link to <a href="http://tuaw.com/">The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a>'s recent post about <a href="http://tuaw.com/2005/12/29/have-ipod-will-ice-fish/">ice fishing podcasts</a>, yes, apparently the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/index.html">DNR</a> has a <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/news/podcasts/index.html">podcast on ice fishing</a>!  There truly is a podcast for anyone.
