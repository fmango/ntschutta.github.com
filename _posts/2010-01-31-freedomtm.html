<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525951571?ie=UTF8&tag=ntschuttacom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0525951571">Freedom (TM)</a> is Daniel Suarez's followup to one of my favorite books of 2009 - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451228731?ie=UTF8&tag=ntschuttacom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0451228731">Daemon</a>. Required reading for last year's Hackers B and B, Daemon is a geek friendly book that includes a main character using a perfectly realistic SQL attack to hack into a computer (there's no "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFUlAQZB9Ng">this is UNIX</a>" moment from Jurassic Park here.) Suarez is to geek what Tom Clancy is to military: dead on details abound. I tore through Daemon and I hotly awaited the conclusion of his epic tale. I was not disappointed.

The Daemon is the creation of an ultra rich (mad?) genius game designer Matthew Sobol. When Sobol dies of brain cancer, he unleashes his program on the world where it reeks havoc. Throughout his first book, we're lead to believe the Daemon is ultimately an evil creation but Freedom(TM) shows us the other side of Sobol's work. Indeed, we find a new world order emerging as darknet members (people who've joined with the Daemon) form new communities committed to sustainability (it's easy to see where Suarez was influenced by <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2010/01/22/omnivores-dilemma/">Omnivoreâ€™s Dilemma</a>.) Of course the old guard fights back as it sees its power and influence begin to wane...

I don't want to say too much and ruin anything, but if you're a geek, a gamer, a programmer or just someone that likes a fast paced action filled book, well then Freedom(TM) is your cup of tea. Some may be put off by the heavy handed political commentary but I wouldn't let that stop you from giving it a go. I hope this isn't the last book from Suarez though he's set the bar awfully high.
