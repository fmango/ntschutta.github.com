I don't know about you, but I have a hard time getting excited about Office - sure, I use Word, Excel and PowerPoint daily but for the last, well, decade, there really hasn't been anything to get too worked up about.  That said, today I watched something that really got my attention.  While I realize this isn't the freshest of news items, the video from <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> (gotta love <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Robert Scoble</a>) on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=114720">Office 12</a> has been kicking around our offices lately and to tell you the truth - it really is quite something (maybe not quite as exciting as the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/14/the-future-of-user-interfaces/">multi touch interface</a>, but c'mon, this is a business application).  The live preview idea is fantastic; (feels rather Ajaxy if I do say so myself!) I can't tell you how many times I've done something only to hit Undo...  I also really like the clean UI - it sure looks like it's a much better approach.  Bravo!

Say what you will about MS but they've got some really bright people and some of the best usability folks around - and for the first time in, well, forever, I'm actually excited about upgrading!
