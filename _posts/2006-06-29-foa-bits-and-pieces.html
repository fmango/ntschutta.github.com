Ryan and I had a rather interesting package waiting for us yesterday - a translated copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&s=books">Foundations of Ajax</a> (I think Korean, but we're not really sure).  I dig the new cover and I've got to say, it's pretty cool to see our book in a different language!

Here are a couple of pix:

There's also a new <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/articles/foundations-of-ajax/">review</a> on Javalobby.  I would like to say that at least a few of the examples run without a Servlet container ;)  and given this particular site's audience, I'm betting people will be just fine.  We certainly could have delved into patterns a bit more and I would direct people to Christian Gross' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1590596161%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1151631732%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8">Ajax Patterns and Best Practices</a> and  <a href="http://softwareas.com/">Michael Mahemoff</a>'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0596101805%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fqid%3D1151631861%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_2%3Fie%3DUTF8">Ajax Design Patterns</a> (also check out his excellent <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/">Ajax Patterns</a> web site).

All in all, a pretty positive review.  As I've mentioned before, given more time, we would have written some examples in some other server side languages.  I was happy to hear that the book has helped the reviewer (Schalk Neethling) and thanks for noticing the tools chapters - lots of people seem to miss those somehow!

By the way, that <strong>*was*</strong> Ryan on <a href="http://www.publicradio.org/columns/futuretense/">Future Tense</a> a while back <a href="http://www.publicradio.org/tools/media/player/news/futuretense/daily/2006/06/21">talking</a> about Ajax...
