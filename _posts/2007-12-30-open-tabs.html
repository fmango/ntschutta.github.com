As the year comes to a close, I wanted to note a few interesting things I've read of late. I'm sure I could come up with a few hundred words about each but the kid is napping so I'll keep this short and to the point. I first ran across <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/december#sun-02-greys_law">this quote</a> on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> (a must read BTW) but seeing it <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/12/does-your-employers-wilful-ignorance-of.html">again</a> on Reg Braithwaite's <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Raganwald</a> spurred me to post it here:



<blockquote>Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice.
</blockquote>


Well, that explains an awful lot.

<a href="http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/">Mike Nygard</a> had an interesting post about some of the <a href="http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/2007/12/budgetecture_and_its_ugly_cous.html">common pathologies</a> we see in this silly industry. I found the part about negotiating particularly fitting but if you haven't seen budgetculture, I'd love to know where you work. My friend <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a> has his <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/12/27/2008+Predictions+2007+Predictions+Redux.aspx">annual prediction piece</a> - lots of very interesting fodder hiding in there. All I have to say is Granny Schottenwilkins has been a proud Mac user for years but I'm sure there are some Windows 98 users in Wisconsin.

Jeff Atwood's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Coding Horror</a> reminds us that we <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001020.html">all write shitty code</a>. I've run into some amazingly arrogant developers that were convinced everything they wrote was pure gold, too bad they're the types that generally don't read, well, anything. Speaking of Jeff, I liked his take on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001021.html">registration keys</a> though I'd point out that some companies trust their users...

Anyway, just a few good reads to finish off 2007. Happy New Year to all three of my readers!
