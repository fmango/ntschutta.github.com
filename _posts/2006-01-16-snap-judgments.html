Well, I'm making up for a few quiet weeks with a smattering of <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/16/history-of-programming-languages/">quick</a> <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/16/code-freeze-slides/">hit</a> posts (and, maybe one longer one...we'll see).  I ran into a post on <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/">Seth Godin</a>'s blog <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/blink.html">about how quickly people judge your website</a> and I just had to post this.  Seth points to a recent article: <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060109/full/060109-13.html">Web users judge sites in the blink of an eye</a> on <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/index.html">news @ nature.com</a>.  Apparently, we have about 50 milliseconds to impress users.  Yes, that's 50 milliseconds...ouch.

I knew people could make some quick assessments - I mean at our core, we are just fantastic pattern matchers as Ray Kurzweil explains in this <a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/interviews/v7i01_kurzweil.html">recent interview</a> found on <a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/">ACM Ubiquity</a> (I'm going to have to, ahh, borrow <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0670033847%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1137460166%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">The Singularity is Near</a> from my dad...and if you really want to bend your mind a bit, check out <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/index.html?flash=1">his website</a>).  Anyway, if you've read the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0316172324%2Fqid%3D1137460403%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Blink</a> (and I plan to - thanks in no small part to <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/default.aspx">Ted Neward</a>'s <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2005/12/08/THE+Book+To+Read+For+2006.aspx">recommendation</a>.  You may want to read <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/01/book_review_mal.html">Eric Freeman's review</a> on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a> as well) Malcolm Gladwell explores snap judgments.  But 50 milliseconds - that'll keep people like me up at night!
