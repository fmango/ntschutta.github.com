On Tuesday, Ryan and I had the distinct pleasure of <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/20060418.html">speaking</a> at the <a href="http://www.otug.org/">Object Technology User Group</a> (OTUG) - many thanks to Aleh Matus for having us.  If you've never checked out OTUG, I really recommend it.  They've had quite a string of amazing speakers including <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/20051115.html">Michael Feathers</a>, <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/20051018.html">Andy Hunt</a>, <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/20050920.html">Obie Fernandez</a>, <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/20050517.html">Gavin King</a>, <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/200404.html">Eric Evans</a>, and <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/200402.html">Martin Fowler</a>.  The gorgeous weather we've been having lately kept the crowd a little sparse but we got some great questions including "does Ajax scale" which I'll discuss in a bit.

There were some friendly faces in the crowd including my protege and former coffee buddy Joe Athman ('bout time you came, sorry you didn't win something), my manager Scott Rens along with those rabble rousers Jason Selby and Eric Vossler (apologies if I've misspelled any names).  <a href="http://taconite.sourceforge.net/">Taconite</a> user and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1437173&forum_id=474577">contributor</a> Eric Olson was also present - thanks for making the long drive, hope the weather held off!  We had a great time and really enjoyed ourselves - thanks to all that came.  Of course I was a little concerned that my <a href="http://csbsju.edu/">SJU</a> license plates would draw unwanted attention to my vehicle - after all, OTUG is hosted by arch rival St. Thomas...

Anyway, here are the <a href="/slides/Foundations of Ajax OTUG.pdf">slides</a> -  as usual, this is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 License</a>.

By the way, if you host a user group or similar gathering and you're looking for a speaker, please let Ryan or me know - we're always interested and we work cheap ;)
