Over on <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/">JavaWorld</a>, you can see my latest article: <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-05-2009/jw-05-javascript-tools.html">Ajax: Tools of the trade</a>. If it's been a while since you looked at client side development and you still think alerts are the end all be all of web debugging, you might want to give it a read. Here's the official summary:

<blockquote>Where JavaScript developers were once tool-deprived, today we're often overwhelmed with the abundance of options. In this article, Foundations of Ajax author Nathaniel T. Schutta reviews development environments, debuggers, testing tools, and utilities that elevate JavaScript to first-class status in the Web development world. If you're still programming JavaScript in a text editor, this survey of the modern tools landscape should open your eyes -- and could make your life much easier.</blockquote>
