Tonight my good friend Linnea tied the knot!  It was a gorgeous summer day (I told you we had a few) and we had a wonderful time.  The ceremony was surprisingly short for a full blown Catholic wedding (I'm a recovering Catholic myself with a dozen years of uniforms and nuns under my belt.)  The church and the hall were great; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Minneapolis">Northeast</a> has really seen quite a revitalization!  The food was excellent and it was really great catching up with my friends Molly (I'm jealous of your new car!), Andrea, Christine (aka Elder) and Derek.  I just don't get to see enough of you all!

I'm really happy for Linnea and Curtis - I wish you two a lifetime of happiness!
