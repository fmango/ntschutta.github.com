March is a busy month on the conference circuit - in addition to <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2009/02/07/speaking-at-qcon-london/">speaking at QCon London</a>, I'll be at <a href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/">TheServerSide.com's Java Symposium</a> talking about <a href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/html/language.html#NSchuttaDSL">DSLs in JavaScript</a> (yes Virginia, there's a real programming language in there.) They've lined up some great speakers - should be an amazing show!
