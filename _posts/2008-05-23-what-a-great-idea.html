Surfing my <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NetNewsWire.aspx">blog reader</a> the other day, I couldn't help but react to the news <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/business/news/index.cfm?RSS&NewsID=21395">about Microsoft bringing ads to the Zune</a>. Boy, that ought to <strong>*really*</strong> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/may#fri-09-zune">help</a> <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/08/05/09/ms.sells.2m.zunes">sales</a>. <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Reg Braithwaite</a> has <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/05/are-you-customer.html">commented</a> on this already but I've really got to wonder how long it'll take companies to figure out that putting the <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">customer</a> first <a href="http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/taylor/2008/05/why_zappos_pays_new_employees.html">works</a>. I think Reg hits on it - we aren't the target market here, shareholders or marketing departments are. Clearly the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/19/apple-wants-more-mobile-music-from-labels/">music industry</a> doesn't get it but anyone want to wager on the likelihood of ads on an iPod? Only <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080521/ap_on_bi_ge/american_airlines_reductions">one US air carrier</a> posted a profit in the first quarter and they consider themselves first and foremost a <a href="http://www.southwest.com/about_swa/">customer service organization</a>. Huh. Wonder if there's a connect there? Nah, couldn't be.
