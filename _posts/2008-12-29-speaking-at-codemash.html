I'm a bit late in announcing this, but along with fellow Fluff Talkers <a href="http://kensipe.blogspot.com/2008/12/speaking-at-code-mash-2009.html">Ken Sipe</a>, <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/">Andy Glover</a> and <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/">Venkat Subramaniam</a>, I'll be speaking at <a href="http://codemash.org/default.aspx">CodeMash 2009</a> this January! I'll be talking about Dynamic Languages and the JVM as well as Test Infecting the Legacy Organization. The show is sold out and I've got to admit the idea of hanging out at a water park in the middle of winter sounds darn appealing! Hope to see you there!
