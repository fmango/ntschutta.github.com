Just before the 4th, Ryan and sat down for a chat with Nem and the rest of the crew at <a href="http://geekmuse.net/blog/">Geek Muse</a> - the results are available on <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=78824599">iTunes</a>, from <a href="http://geekmuse.net/podcast/audio/GeekMuse0038.m4a">their site</a> or as a <a href="http://geekmuse.net/podcast/audio/GeekMuse0038.mp3">plain MP3</a>.  Be aware, like <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/27/podcast-with-zerologik/">ZeroLogic</a>, this one carries the Explicit tag...

My wife doesn't think it sounds like me but the audio is great!  Ryan and I had a great time (many thanks Nem, if you ever need another voice, shout!) - enjoy!  Oh, and Nem, thanks for leaving in the part about cream cheese ;)
