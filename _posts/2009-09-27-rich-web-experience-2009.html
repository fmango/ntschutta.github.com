Where would rather be this December, adjusting to winter or spending a few days in Orlando learning about what's new and exciting in JavaScript, Ajax, CSS, HTML, design and a host of other topics? If the later appeals to you, book your seat today at <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/orlando/2009/12/home">The Rich Web Experience</a>! In addition to some great talks by some of the best <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/orlando/2009/12/speakers">speakers</a> in the industry, you'll also have access to the <a href="http://www.jsfsummit.com/conference/orlando/2009/12/home">JSF Summit</a>. I think <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a> has been listening in on some of my Ajax talks - I call it a seasoning, <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2009/09/2009-edition-of-rich-web-experience.html">he calls it a spice</a>, but either way, the user experience is a key to making great applications. See you in Orlando!
