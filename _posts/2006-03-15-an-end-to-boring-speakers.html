title: An End To Boring Speakers

When I read Jay Lehr's <a href="http://www.geol.wwu.edu/rjmitch/stoning.pdf">Let There Be Stoning</a>, I figured he was channeling <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a>...but then I realized he wrote it in 1985.  With quotes like this, I think I can be forgiven for my my mistake:

<blockquote>Let there be an end to incredibly boring speakers!  They are not sophisticated, erudite scientists speaking above our intellectual capability; they are arrogant, thoughtless individuals who insult our very presence by the lack of concern for our desire to benefit from a meeting which we choose to attend.
</blockquote>

In other words, they spend too much time trying to convince the audience how smart they were and not enough on how to help their users kick ass!  I certainly can't speak for Kathy, but I think she would support Jay in the shaming of poor presenters.  I also like this line:

<blockquote>[the speaker] must convey enlightened enthusiasm for his subject and the advances he has attained.
</blockquote>


Now, I've never read anything about bad foils (though I did have a CIO that used transparencies for all of his presentations...) but he takes a shot at those folks that think their audience can't read - in other words, <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/03/calling_an_audi.html">call an audible</a>.  For a comparison, you may want to read Kathy's take on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/06/kill_your_prese.html">deadly presentations</a>. 

<blockquote>A scientist who cannot retain in his head the essence of his latest work can hardly be said to be enraptured by his subject.</blockquote>

My only complaint...the PDF is password protected meaning the good old copy and paste doesn't work.  Sigh.  Way to go <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/">Presentation Zen</a> for <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/03/no_excuse_for_t.html">linking</a> to this article - it should be required reading for technical presenters!
