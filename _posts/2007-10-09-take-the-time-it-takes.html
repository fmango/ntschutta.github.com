In my <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=591">Test Infecting</a> talk, I do my best to counter a number of myths that I (and others) have encountered when introducing testing into an organization. One of the most persistent misconception revolves around time - or rather the lack thereof. Many a developer has claimed they don't have time to test to which I generally reply with a <a href="http://www.parelli.com/home.faces">Pat Parelli</a> quote from <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/so_it_takes_les.html">this post</a> on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a>'s blog:



<blockquote>"Take the time it takes so it takes less time."</blockquote>



Kathy was talking about multitasking but my point is simple: forgo testing and you'll pay that price plus more later when the defects start rolling in. While I <strong>*think*</strong> this is persuasive, <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/category/deans-deprecations">Dean Wampler</a> went one better by using charts which we all know makes for a better argument ;) Dean makes some great points in <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/09/30/why-you-have-time-for-tdd-but-may-not-know-it-yet">Why you have time for TDD (but may not know it yet...)</a> though the part about moving unscheduled project end time up earlier into the project really hit home.

<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/135269">Ranges are fine</a> and the key to success is frequent milestones; as we learn more about the problem domain and the technology we are using, the more accurate our estimates. But most organizations take a random guess (with, I'd say, a <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/10/09/winds-spittle/">wind's spittle</a> of support) and turn that into a concrete date around which the world turns. They then ignore all the little milestones (if they track them at all) or they <a href="http://www.ddj.com/architect/191600661?cid=Ambysoft">green shift</a> the project status. The result is failure, though sometimes we redefine that word to mean something else entirely...
