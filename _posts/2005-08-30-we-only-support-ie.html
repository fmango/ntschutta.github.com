I've been doing this whole "web thing" long enough to remember the good old days of "this site optimized for Internet Explorer" or something similar.  Recently, I've even run into sites that complain about <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> but, that's somewhat understandable.  As a newbie Mac user I've seen some issues in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari</a> though by and large everything works as I would expect.  And, as someone that has played around a lot with <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax</a>, I know too well the issues of cross browser JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

Still, I was absolutely stunned by this article: "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/24/AR2005082401988.html">Copyright Program to Require Explorer</a>."  Now, read carefully, it does say the <a href="http://www.siebel.com/">Siebel Systems</a> wouldn't <em>guarantee</em> there forms would work in another browser (in my mind implying they actually might) but still, to require one browser these days?  I know its not quite the same, but what would happen if <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> decided to that?  Very odd decision if you ask me.  Seriously, how hard could it be?  What are they doing that is <strong>so</strong> much harder than say, <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>?
