Today in <a href="http://www-users.itlabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2007/seng5199/">Dynamic Language camp</a>, we were discussing some of the myths and realities that surround the new darlings of the development world - you know things like "Ruby isn't enterprise", "I need the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/18/nfjs-quotes/">safety of the compiler</a>" and other assorted misconceptions. Anyway, we were talking about the importance of testing in the dynamic space and one of the students brought up null pointers and invariants.  I mentioned that static typing wouldn't prevent someone from passing a null and we went back and forth for a couple of minutes.

The conversation was great (they're a good group - very talkative which makes my job both easier and <strong>*much*</strong> more enjoyable - hmm, wonder if any of them are reading teacher's blog?!?) when, very quietly, another student threw out a killer quote:
<blockquote>"You're arguing about nothing."</blockquote>
Now <strong>*that*</strong> is geek humor! It took a while to sink in and I don't honestly know if it was intended to be funny but it really cracked me (and the students that heard it) up. Needless to say I had to repeat for everyone's consumption!
