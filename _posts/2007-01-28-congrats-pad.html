I want to extend a heartfelt congratulations to <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/">Venkat Subramaniam</a> and <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/">Andy Hunt</a> on <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/pad/">Practices of an Agile Developer</a> being <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/articles/2007/01/18/jolt-award-finalists-announced">named</a> a 2007 Jolt Product Excellence Finalist!  I was lucky enough to get an <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/16/practices-of-an-agile-developer/">early look at PaD</a> and I can't recommend it enough. In case you missed it, <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/index.html">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> has been on quite a run of late - <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a>'s <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/2007/1/25/rails-recipes-is-a-jolt-finalist">Rails Recipes</a> was also named a finalist and this will mark the third year in a row that a Prag book as made the list (they've won two for the record). Anyway, a big W00T to Venkat, Andy, and Chad!!
