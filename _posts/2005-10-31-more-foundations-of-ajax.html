Well, Ryan and I are just delighted at the response we've gotten to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127567332/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a>!  We've enjoyed a very strong Amazon Sales Rank and the second printing will be underway shortly so hopefully the expected shipping times will be dropping soon.  To all of you that have put down your hard earned money for out book, a thousand thank-yous and to those of you that are marking time for a book to ship we appreciate your patience.  If you just can't wait, you can always order the <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10042">eBook</a> version from <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a>...

Since I last wrote, we've gotten a few more mentions that I'd like to highlight here.  First off, many thanks to the good folks at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/index.html">NetBeans</a> - they mentioned us in <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/community/news/newsletter/2005-10-27.html">this week's newsletter</a>.  As I've mentioned before in <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/10/16/early-reviews-of-foundations-of-ajax/">Early Reviews of Foundations of Ajax</a>, Ryan and I wrote all of the examples in NetBeans, he on a Windows box, me on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html">PowerBook</a>.  We are also featured on their <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/kb/articles/books.html">books</a> page in the "<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/kb/articles/books.html#use">uses</a>" section.

Speaking of NetBeans, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen">Roumen</a> was kind enough to mention us in his blog: <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen?entry=learning_ajax_with_foundations_of">Learning Ajax With Foundations of Ajax and NetBeans</a>.  Thanks, we really appreciate the mention and are anxiously awaiting greater Ajax support in NetBeans.  I fully expect that some of the features mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/tor">Tor Norbye's</a> piece <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/tor?entry=creator_and_ajax_the_demo">Creator and AJAX: The Demo</a> will find their way into NetBeans soon.

As a new Mac user, I was particularly delighted to come across <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/RuiCarmo">Rui Carmo</a> of <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space">Tao of Mac</a> and the review of <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2005-10-29">Foundations of Ajax</a>.  Yes, we realize many of the examples used Java (though we also used XML to "mock" the server - so we were particularly interested in David Crane's <a href="http://dave.sunwheeltech.com/wordpress/2005/10/17/mocking-the-server-side/">Mocking the Server Side</a> blog.  BTW, congrats on the book!)  Despite the Java emphasis (sorry, it really is our specialty) Rui gives us good marks.  I particularly like this statement:

<blockquote>Like the few other Apress books I've been exposed to, Foundations of Ajax, becomes "sticky" due to its balanced approach - it's something you read instead of just dipping in and picking up quick recipes to scratch whatever itch you may have, and the smooth ramping in complexity as techniques unfold makes for a good learning experience.</blockquote>

Glad to hear Foundations of Ajax is a good read!

We have a newish 5 star <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/1590595823/ref=cm_cr_dp_pt?%5Fencoding=UTF8%26n=5%26s=books">review on Amazon</a> written by Kavita Devi of <a href="http://ajaxgoals.com/">ajaxgoals.com</a>.  Once again, the last half of the book was called out as especially helpful.  I would like to add that despite what the review says, we do have an <a href="http://www.apress.com/ApressCorporate/supplement/1/10042/1590595823-3022.pdf">appendix</a> that mentions frameworks though I should caution that the space is evolving so quickly anything we wrote was pretty much guaranteed to be outdated the second we wrote it.

Last (but certainly not least) we have <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2005/10/5/1284005.html">a mention</a> on <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog">The Farm</a>.  Thanks guys - we look forward to <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2005/10/31/1332916.html">your thoughts</a> on the book!  I suspect we'll have a few more things to mention in upcoming weeks but just a reminder that Ryan and I will be <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JUGPresentation.aspx?TopicID=94">discussing Ajax</a> at the next <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JavaUserGroup.aspx">Twin Cities Java User Group</a> meeting.  We'd love to see you there!
