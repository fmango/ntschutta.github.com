I had lunch with my friend <a href="http://www.unpossible.com/">Dan</a> on Monday (and finally got to a <a href="http://ruby.mn/">RUM</a> meeting...) and he mentioned that local guru <a href="http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/index.html">Mike Nygard</a> was on a <a href="http://pragprog.com/podcasts">recent Pragmatic Podcast</a>. As you might expect, I pointed iTunes at the feed and was not disappointed. Mike wrote <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mnee">Release It</a>, a very important book on making sure your code is production ready. Anyway, well worth a listen. Speaking of podcasts, my friends <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a> and <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/">Andy Glover</a>'s chat on JRuby et al is <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/podcasts/jtech/2007/112007jtech006.html">up on JavaWorld</a>. Good stuff guys! BTW, Andy, if you're looking for other people for podcasts, I  <strong>*cough*</strong> know a guy.
