Old Ajax hand <a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/blogs/brentashley/">Brent Ashley</a> has broken what I can only hope was a self imposed silence today with <a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/blogs/brentashley/2007/02/12/javascript-the-web-20-developers-babelfish/">Javascript - the Web 2.0 developerâ€™s Babelfish</a>. I must say I agree with Brent's "unformed" idea: some of today's popular JavaScript libraries try to make JS "feel" more like a different language. I make this point when I talk about Ajax or when people quiz me about which library is perfect for them - if <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> makes your skin crawl, chances are you won't like <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> and many of the Java guys I know adore <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> since it allows them to stay in their comfort zone.

As much as I agree with his post, never forget that JavaScript is JavaScript - a <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=cccd4aa02a3993ab06e56af731346f78.1710507">perfectly fine language</a> thank you very much. It's natural to <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/02/12/software-is-like/">make analogies</a> but those can be dangerous ;)
