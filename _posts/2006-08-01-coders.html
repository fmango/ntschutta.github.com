Have you seen that EarthLink commercial, you know, the one where they tell you that geeks get the job done?  Well, <a title="Hedius" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> is a geek - plain and simple.  His recent post, <a title="On Coding" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/07/on-coding.html">On Coding</a>, is definitely worth a read.  While I'm not nearly the night owl he is (well, when I do stay up late, I certainly don't wake up at 7 am!) I certainly identify with a lot of what he's saying.  Charles is dead on when he talks about <a title="Creating Passionate Users" href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">passion</a> and while I think it's good to have more developers with <a title="Customer Affinity" href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CustomerAffinity.html">customer affinity</a>, I want those with some zeal, dang-it!

In the late '90s, a lot of people entered this profession - if you could spell Oracle, you were golden.  While I certainly appreciated this attitude during the period I was looking for that all important first job, it was quite a shock when I started working with folks for whom software was just a job.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think people have to eat, breathe, sleep this stuff (I really appreciate being able to carry on a conversation about, you know, sports or something) but to really excel at this stuff, it has to be more than a passing fancy.  Yes, coders are <a title="Trav hates geeks?" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/31/does-travelers-insurance-hate-geeks/">mocked</a> and software is incredibly artistic.  And yes, companies that "get it" do extremely well.  The sad thing though - few places seem to really want the passionate among us...wonder why that is.
