By now, it should be obvious that there are quite a few books out there on Ajax...and it seems like <a title="Pro Ajax and Java" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/15/pro-ajax-and-java-frameworks/">new one's</a> are published every day!  In case you were curious, <a title="Michael Mahemoff's site" href="http://softwareas.com/">Michael Mahemoff</a> (author of <a title="Ajax Design Patterns" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0596101805%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fqid%3D1154275788%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_2%3Fie%3DUTF8">Ajax Design Patterns</a> and proprietor of <a title="Ajax Patterns" href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/">AjaxPatterns.org</a>) has added a <a title="Ajax Books Page" href="http://softwareas.com/ajax-books-page">list of books</a> to his <a title="Ajax Patterns - Books page" href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Books">popular site</a>.
