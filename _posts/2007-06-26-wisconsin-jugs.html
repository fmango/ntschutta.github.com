If you find yourself in Milwaukee or Madison in the next day or two, come see me speak! Courtesy of <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff Just Stuff</a>, I'm heading across the boarder right into the heart of Badger country. Tonight I'll be at the <a href="http://www.wjug.org/wjug/nextmeeting.jsp">Wisconsin Java User Group</a> and tomorrow I'll be at the <a href="http://www.madjug.org/madjug/nextmeeting.jsp">Madison JUG</a> - or MadJUG as they say in these parts ;)
