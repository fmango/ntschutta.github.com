Well, more than a few people have picked up on the various articles floating around regarding Ajax and scalability.  Thanks to Michael Mahemoff for reading <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ajax-and-scaleability">my piece</a> and reposting it (check the <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ajax-and-scaleability#comments">comments</a>). Stuart Halloway over on Relevance <a href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/04/21/ajax-and-server-scalability-theory-and-practice">also picked up on the thread</a> (alas he didn't notice my commentary...) and made a great point - the server vendors win in this game!  Interestingly, this is the second time in less than a week that I've read a variant of this quote (though it's not attributed in Stuart's article, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_reason">wikipedia</a>, it's Jan L. A. van de Snepscheut).  

<blockquote>In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.</blockquote>

Anyway, good call on the server vendors - they should all be lining up behind Ajax (is it a coincidence that <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1917665,00.asp">IBM leads</a> the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/atf/">Open Ajax</a> project?)  Dave Johnson also gets into the mix with <a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/dave/?p=121">Scaling AJAX</a>.  I liked his allusion to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145487/">Spider Man</a> but he made a great I was really glad to see him refer to the MacRumors post on <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/events/mwsf2006-stats.php">handling the Macworld keynote</a> (see the <a href="http://www.macrumorslive.com/about/">overview</a> as well).

It took a few days, but seems like this issue has gotten some visibility!
<strong>Update:</strong>

Scott over on the <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/blog/">Zimbra</a> blog has a great take on <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/blog/archives/2006/04/ajax_impact_on.html">Ajax and scaling</a>.  I particularly like referring to Ajax apps as "husky" as opposed to thin or thick and he's dead on with this comment:


<blockquote>In terms of its broader application architecture, the Web platform looks a lot more like a mainframe application: Yes, the 3270 green screen is replaced by a far richer browser and hypertext mark-up, but more of the UI and virtually all of the business logic (modulo Javascript field validation) is done on the server. </blockquote>


At one point, I had a CIO that called our web apps "lipstick on a pig" - we were <em>just</em> webifying mainframe apps...  That said, most of my customers really enjoyed not having a character limit to their screens!
