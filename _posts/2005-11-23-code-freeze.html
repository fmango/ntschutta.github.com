I'm pleased to announce that I will be <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/details/schutta.html">speaking about Ajax</a> at the upcoming <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/index.html">Code Freeze</a> at the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/index.php">University of Minnesota</a>.  Looking at the local luminaries on the schedule, I'm amazed to find myself in their midsts.

It's a chance to see a great slate of speakers including James Rumbaugh!  The cost is very reasonable at $70 ($50 if you are a student or an MSSE alum) which includes all the talks, breakfast, lunch, snacks, and the program material.  Here's the email that's going around:



<blockquote>The first annual Code Freeze Symposium will be held on Friday January 13, 2006, presented by the University of Minnesota Software Engineering Center. This is a chance to meet your colleagues and share experiences and best practices in our profession. The theme this year will be "Enterprise Architecture and Development." Details and registration are now available at <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/index.html">http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/index.html
</a>
We will have a full day of talks and discussions focused on practical application of Software Engineering to real-life enterprise architecture and development problems. Our keynote speakers will be James Rumbaugh, one of the leading software development methodologists in the world, and Bran Selic, who has contributed extensively to the definition of Model Driven Development (MDD) methods and tools.

Other speakers this year include David Hussman of SGF, Jim Pichler of Digital River, Mike Calvo of Citronella Software, Don Monk of General Mills, Nate Schutta of PTC, and Scott Costello of Unisys. See the symposium program for details.

The symposium will be held in the EE/CS building on the University of Minnesota East Bank campus, from 8:30-17:00, with registration and breakfast starting at 8:00. The cost of the program is $70, which covers the program, continental breakfast, snacks, and materials. If you register by 9 January, we'll include free parking in the Washington Avenue Ramp. Students and alumni of the University's Master of Science in Software Engineering program can pay a discounted price of $50. For more information, please contact Kim Kramer at 612-625-1381 or kkramer at cs dot umn dot edu.

We hope to see you there.
