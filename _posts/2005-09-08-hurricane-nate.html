You know it's a busy hurricane season (and lets not forget - officially, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season">it runs until</a> November 30th) when they get down to my name in the <a href="http://www.weather.com/newscenter/topstories/20050601hurricanenames.html">list</a>!  That said the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/hurricane.html">predicted an above normal Atlantic hurricane season</a>.  Anyway, I do think it's kind of neat that the 14th named storm shares my moniker.  I didn't realize that list repeated every 6 years (with particularly devestating storms retired - sorry Katrina!)

Here's an <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/sfl-nate,0,7273676.story">article</a> from the <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/">Sun-Sentinel</a> that mentions Nate, Google News' <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=hurricane+nate&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=nn&oi=newsr">take on it</a>, and NOAA's <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at5+shtml/">thoughts</a> on where it might be headed.  Silly I know, but it's not often I run into people with my name let alone a hurricane!  I just hope I, err, hurricane Nate, doesn't cause much damage.  Right now, it looks like it will just graze Bermuda.

I have to admit, I really like sites that provide syndication and I've been plesantly surprised by how many organzitions have started offering this service.  While reading up on "my" hurricane, I couldn't help but notice that <a href="feed://www.nhc.noaa.gov/nhc_at5.xml">NOAA offers feeds</a>.  What a great idea - that has to be very useful for people affected by these storms.
