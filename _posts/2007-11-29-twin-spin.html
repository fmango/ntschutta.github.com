Just a heads up that I'll be speaking at <a href="http://twin-spin.cs.umn.edu/index.php">Twin SPIN</a> next week - here are the <a href="http://twin-spin.cs.umn.edu/events.php?id=148">details</a>. I'll be giving one of this season's <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/index.jsp">No Fluff</a> <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=591">talks</a>. Hope to see you there! Unfortunately that means I won't be at the latest edition of <a href="http://minnedemo.org/">Minnedemo</a> but I think that just gives you an idea of just how much tech goodness is happening in the Twin Cities these days.
