If you want to see a cool Ajax based contact manager that takes advantage of ColdFusionMX and SQL Server (once again proving that Ajax is completely agnostic about the server), head on over to <a href="http://www.propeller-head.biz/demo/">this example</a> from John Theis.  John  was kind enough to point out a couple of typos in our sample code and has given us some great feedback (seriously, we listen to this stuff).  Thanks John - cool demo!  Oh yeah and we're glad you enjoyed <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/09/24/foundations-of-ajax/">Foundations of Ajax</a>!
