The other day I gave a presentation with a set of links in it and when I mentioned that to my friend Charles (no, not <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">that</a> one) he said post them to the blog. So, let it never be said I don't listen to my constituents!

First and foremost is an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/poppendieck-lean-2007">interview</a> with Mary and Tom Poppendieck over on <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a>. By the way, <strong>*great*</strong> content Floyd - if you haven't been keeping track of the latest offering from Mr. Marinescu, you really should. I also posted a couple of articles on multitasking, something that I've commented on in <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/01/28/quick-is-slow/">Quick is Slow</a> and <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/18/you-have-11-minutes/">You Have 11 Minutes</a>. I pointed to two posts from <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a>: <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/03/your_brain_on_m.html">Your brain on multitasking</a> and <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/03/multitasking_ma.html">Multitasking makes us stupid?</a>  Along the same vein is an oldie but goodie from <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html">Human Task Switches Considered Harmful</a>. I've said it before and I'll say it again - multitasking is a myth. People seem to harbor this insane notion that they can juggle half a dozen high priority tasks and do justice to them all...sorry, it's not possible. But continue to believe that. Really.

Anyway, from the look of my inbox I'm going to have to do a deck clearer post...there's been a lot of great articles out there that I've been meaning to comment on but have lacked sufficient time (something that I'll have in even shorter supply in coming weeks!) If you're getting the snow we are here, I hope you don't have to drive anywhere this weekend...
