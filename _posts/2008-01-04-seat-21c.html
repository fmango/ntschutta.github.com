When I was in <a href="http://www.msse.umn.edu/">graduate school</a>, one of my <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~konstan/">professors</a> gave us a trip report on a conference he had attended. After class we started chatting and he told me that the goal was to travel enough that you wanted to start traveling less - needless to say, I now know exactly what he meant (see <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/10/20/ah-travel/">here</a>, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/02/08/random-travel-notes/">here</a> and <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/06/03/thats-interesting/">here</a> for various tales of the glories of trips past...) For those of you that don't fly much, the <a href="http://jetlagged.blogs.nytimes.com/">Jet Lagged</a> blog's  <a href="http://jetlagged.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/a-users-manual-to-seat-21c/">A Userâ€™s Manual to Seat 21C</a> pretty well covers the joy that is getting on an airplane these days. Of course some of my <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/">friends</a> fly so much that <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">they</a> haven't seen a seat past row 4 in years but even <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">they</a> have their own horror stories to share ;).
