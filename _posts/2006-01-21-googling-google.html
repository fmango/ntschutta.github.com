I suppose it was just a matter of time.  First prosecutors <a href="http://www.wral.com/news/5287261/detail.html">used a man's search records </a>against him in a murder trial, now the government has requested that the major search engines turn over a random sampling of 1 million searches in an attempt to revive an <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">Internet pornography law</a> that was struck down by the Supreme Court as being too broad.  <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-218.ZS.html">The decision</a> against the law points out that filters would be more effective and that websites could simply move their operations overseas to avoid the prosecution.

Not surprisingly, this story is getting A LOT of press right now (as of now, over 1000 hits on <a href="http://news.google.com/nwshp?tab=wn&ned=us&ncl=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-2002328,00.html&hl=en&scoring=d">Google News</a>) and it was a significant part of <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2134555/?nav=navoa">Friday's edition</a> of "Today's Papers" on <a href="http://www.slate.com/">Slate</a>.  The story has been covered by pretty much everyone including: the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/technology/13657303.htm">San Jose Mercury News</a>, the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google20jan20,0,6995079.story?coll=la-home-headlines">LA Times</a>, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/AR2006011903331_pf.html">Washington Post</a> and on <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6028701.html?tag=nl.e589">ZDNet</a>.

Personally, I find this particularly disturbing in the light of the recent <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/17/bush.nsa/">domestic wiretap scandal</a> (which appears to produce great leads: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/17/politics/17spy.html?pagewanted=print">on soccer moms and pizza joints</a>).  I suspect this is a bit of a trial balloon - most won't defend porn and once you've turned over search records for one reason, it makes it that much easier to ask for, say all searches on "bomb making" or "donate to al-Qaeda".  I mean, heck, apparently in a <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/e0904272-8942-11da-94a6-0000779e2340.html">time of war</a>, the executive branch can do anything it wants, right?  I'll probably find myself on a watch list shortly after I post this!

But at least Google is fighting back unlike the other search engines - I can't believe they all rolled so easily (OK, so a couple claim they only gave the Justice Department some of what they want) but when you consider that they <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B54C61B89-2A96-4DAD-A844-A9B994AE79C7%7D&siteid=google">all bow down to China's requests</a> for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/weekinreview/15zeller.html">dissidents' identities</a> we shouldn't be too surprised.  Hey, the the lure of a huge consumer market is worth "bending" principles a bit, right?  Oh wait, it's all about share holder value.  Never mind.  I hope that Google is successful especially in light of this quote from the LA Times article which is particularly frightening if you believe in civil liberties (my emphasis):



<blockquote>Under a section of the Patriot Act expanding the use of so-called national security letters, companies such as Google can be asked to turn over potentially useful data â€” <strong>even about people who aren't suspected of wrongdoing</strong> â€” while being barred from disclosing those requests.</blockquote>



Wow.  Have you ever searched for something that you might not want the government sifting through?  How long until they start fishing through the huge email stores on Gmail and Yahoo Mail?  Of course maybe they <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051220-5808.html">already are</a>...
