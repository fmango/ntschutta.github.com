Well, we've been quiet long enough!  After a hectic summer of writing, Ryan and I are proud to say <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127567332/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ntschuttacom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is on its way to the printers.  Special thanks to everyone at <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a> for your help - we could not have done this without your extraordinary effort!  We're not 100 percent sure when it'll start shipping, but expect to see it soon.  If you're not familiar with Ajax, a quick Google search will reveal a number of responses but you should start with Jesse James Garrett's piece <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications</a>.

We really believe in Ajax (heck, we did write a book and I assure you it was not for the money!) and we think it will truly change the way people write web applicaitons.  If you've played with <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> or seen <a href="http://www.netflix.com/BrowseSelection">Netflix's box cover hover</a>, you'll know why we're so jazzed about this.  Anyway, Ryan and I have really tried to write a book that will actually help developers.  While Ajax isn't rocket science, there are a number of things that can jump up and bite you; our book will put a few more arrows in your quiver!  We really focused on the developer's toolbox with this book and we really hope it helps people add Ajax to their applications.

<strong>Update: looks like one of the chapters isn't available online anymore howerver the <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/supplementDownload.html?bID=10042&sID=3022">table of contents</a> is.</strong>

Enjoy!

I'll have more to say on this in the future and look for some promotional type stuff in the coming weeks.  I will say that <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JUGPresentation.aspx?TopicID=94">we are presenting</a> at <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JavaUserGroup.aspx">TC JUG</a> in November so if you're in the Twin Cities, come on down!
