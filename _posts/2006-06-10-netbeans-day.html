As a <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/index.html">NetBeans</a> guy, I was pretty jazzed to attend NetBeans day held just before <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/">JavaOne</a>.  While I got a pretty funny look from <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/">Andrew Glover</a> at the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=47">Twin Cities Software Symposium</a> when I said I said I didn't use Eclipse, <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/community/articles/javaone/2006/nb-day.html">NetBeans Day 2006</a> made it clear that there is plenty of buzz surrounding Sun's open source IDE.  The standing room only crowd (the fire marshall was literally involved) made moving about a challenge but it was really great to that see so many people were excited about NetBeans.  While I love it, I think NetBeans has the same issue that afflicts <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/">EJB 3.0</a> - people that used it early suffered.  I've said it before - if you haven't tried NetBeans since 3.x days, you really owe it to yourself to <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">take it for a spin</a>.

The highlight for me was seeing the <a href="http://jackpot.netbeans.org/">Jackpot</a> project in action.  While we've all come to expect refactoring support in our IDEs, Jackpot takes things to a whole new level.  Since it works at the AST level, you're allowed more powerful pattern matching than you get with plain text.  Writing and sharing rules is relatively easy meaning you can quickly develop a library of powerful refactorings.  I was also very impressed by the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/products/enterprise/index.html">Enterprise Pack</a>, especially its <a href="http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/javatools/jsenterprise/tpr/learning/tutorials/uml_fe.html#roundtrip">bidirectional</a> <strong>markerless</strong> <a href="http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/javatools/jsenterprise/tpr/learning/tutorials/uml_fe.html">UML modeling</a> and I recommend taking a look at the <a href="http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/javatools/jsenterprise/tpr/reference/presentations/xmltools/xmltools.htm">XML tools</a> as well.  Of course watching them debug a mobile application that was <em>running on the cell phone</em>, was pretty impressive.

I also enjoyed having a chance to chat with NetBeans evangelist <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen">Rouman Strobl</a> (I *really* like the new glyph shirts - they were so popular that they ran out of my size at NB day.  I'm hoping some light groveling will encourage Mr. Strobl to send one my way).  I highly recommend the <a href="http://roumen.name/blog/nb_movie/netbeans_worldtour_movie.avi">NetBeans WorldTour video</a> as well - thanks for plugging <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&s=books">Foundations of Ajax</a> guys!  BTW, here's a pic from after the event:
