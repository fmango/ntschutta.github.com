I ran into this <a href="http://davidweiss.blogspot.com/2007/03/cool-kids.html">hierarchy of programming languages</a> over at <a href="http://davidweiss.blogspot.com/index.html">David Weiss</a>' blog (originally posted by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/steverowe/archive/2007/03/14/programming-language-hierarchy.aspx">Steve Rowe</a>). It's quite humorous (seriously, VB is higher up than Ada?) and I'm sure it's just understood that Smalltalkers are superior to everyone!
