I've seen my share of spam over the years and most of the time I'm just stunned anyone falls for it. I mean, come on - who actually thinks that some stranger needs to move 10 or 20 million in hard currency out of their war torn/ravaged country and for some reason they trust YOU to help with this critical mission? Sure, it sounds like a great deal but, gez, I doubt my 4 month old would fall for that. But, we don't live in <a href="http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/?refid=6">Lake Wobegon</a> so it I suppose it shouldn't be that surprising. Anyway, of late there's been some spam on the <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> discussion <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/firebug">group</a> and while I've deleted most of it on site, this one caught me eye:



<blockquote>Road Map To Riches - Another 2-UP Scam

Road Map To Riches is yet Another 2-Up scheme in the pipeline! Akin to EDC Gold and Passport to Wealth among others, this program is designed to suck gobs of cash out of you and leave you wallowing in your embarrassment for having been so foolish.
</blockquote>


Wow, how refreshingly honest! I really pity the person that falls for that line.
