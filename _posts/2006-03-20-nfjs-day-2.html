As much as I wanted to get this posted, you know, Saturday, I just didn't have time.  After the birds of a feather, I spent a good bit of time chatting with <a href="http://relevancellc.com/blogs/index.php">Justin Gehtland</a> about Ajax, Ruby, and Mac tricks so my whole evening was delayed.  Of course after spending 10 hours drinking down the tech love, I just couldn't convince myself to open the laptop.  Speaking of which, I'm a bit behind on my email and whatnot so if you don't hear from me for a couple of days, my apologies!  Though the BoF started as a <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">AOP</a> discussion, it devolved into a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>/<a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby</a> and why <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">Mac</a>'s are better talk.  I asked what would be more likely in two years - that we'd all be using AOP or we'd be programming in Ruby; needless to say, this got quite rise out of Justin!  BTW, for those of you that think <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs/?p=92">there's no money</a> to be made with Ruby...well, just ask Justin what he's been up to these days (and they are some impressive apps!)

On the people front, I ran into a few more folks I knew including <a href="http://www.citronellasoftware.com/">Mike Calvo</a> (I swear, he asked a great question in every session he was in) and I also had a chance to chat with <a href="http://www.sgfco.com/">David Hussman</a> - what a great guy!  You know, this year I really found myself wishing for more time between sessions to talk with people.  Anyway, on to the show...

I began my day with <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/">Venkat</a>'s <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=287">refactoring</a> talk and as I expected, it was great!  I really can't say enough good things about Venkat's presentation style - it really is a pleasure.  I especially liked his reference to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0060006641%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1142906862%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">On Writing Well</a> and its principles of simplicity, clarity, brevity, and most importantly, humanity.  I couldn't help but think that we spend way too much of our time worrying about the computer when in truth we need to write for our fellow developers.  I like to follow the homicidal maniac theory - in other words, I pretend that the person maintaining my code is a serial killer and he knows where I live so on the off chance he's digging through my code at 2 am, I'd like him to think happy thoughts about me.  Anyway, as I expected a great talk with live coding (damn, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> is sweet).

After that, I sat in on Justin Gehtland's talk on <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=342">JavaScript</a>.  I have to admit, I was quite interested to see Justin in person.  You see on <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/17/nfjs-day-1/">Day 1</a>, I spent my entire afternoon in the break out room next to his and all I have to say is, the man is <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">passionate</a>!  A couple of times I swear he was channeling <a href="http://www.emerils.com/">Emeril</a> (<strong>BAM!</strong>) and I even detected a couple of <a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/CNBCTV/TV_Info/P108231.asp">Jim Cramer</a>-esque <strong>BOOYAs</strong>...  Needless to say, I was <strong>*not*</strong> disappointed.  I <em>cannot</em> say enough good things about Justin (and I'm not just saying that because  he recommends our book.)  Not only did he fill me on his Mac must haves (<a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, <a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Utilities/Desktop-Manager.shtml">Desktop Manager</a>, and <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>) but he's also a foody!  We both share a passion for cooking, <a href="http://foodtv.com/">FoodTV</a> and <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/">Alton Brown</a>.  If you <strong>*ever*</strong> have a chance to see Justin live (like, say, <a href="http://railsconf.org/talks/selected/show/100">RailsConf</a>), do not hesitate.

In the afternoon is was back to the phenomenal <a href="http://jroller.com/page/dgeary">David Geary</a> for <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=250">Ajaxian Faces</a> and <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=245">Hands on Rails</a>.  In both sessions, David did a fair amount of live coding and it was impressive.  Sure, I know he had a lot of the code hiding in IntelliJ's smart templates and what not but still...pretty darn impressive.  Of course how he handled things <em>not</em> working was quite something - very cool under pressure.  I enjoyed watching someone else covering Ajax and I'm becoming more and more impressed with <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/">JSF</a> but I'm not quite ready to <a href="http://timshadel.com/2006/01/19/jsf-the-7-layer-burrito-i-wont-eat-again/">eat the 7-layer burrito</a>...  Of course the Rails session was amazing but I was surprised by two things - how few people actually went (I really expected a packed room) and the fact that there was only one session the entire weekend on Ruby and Rails combined...  No matter how many times I see it, Rails still impresses me.  When you watch someone code an entire application, live, in just a few minutes, well, it gets your attention.

Couple of other comments on David Geary's talks.  First, he takes advantage of a great Mac feature - the Universal Access panel - to magnify portions of his screen so folks in the back could read the code.  Rather than tweak his font settings, he just zoomed in!  Very slick - I am going to have to use this next time I present code.  Another interesting point, David has a fascinating hobby - French.  Yes, he has his language set not to English, but to French...  Way cool!

Well, I think that about covers Day 2...
