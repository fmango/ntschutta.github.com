The <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/dsls-in-javascript">video</a> of my DSLs in JavaScript talk <a href="/slides/DSLs_in_JavaScript.pdf">[slides - pdf]</a> from <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/">QCon</a> is now available on the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> site; many thanks to all those who have written me or tweeted links, I appreciate it! I can't say enough good things about QCon, it's a great show with some amazing talks - if you have a chance to go, you really should. But, if getting to London or San Francisco (two of my absolutely favorite cities) isn't on the radar screen, the next best thing is watching the fantastic videos you'll find posted regularly on InfoQ. Enjoy!
