Ryan and I were delighted to chat with the lads from <a title="ZeroLogik" href="http://www.zerologik.com/">ZeroLogik</a> late last week and the results have been <a title="ZeroLogik 38" href="http://zerologik.com/2006/10/zerologik_038_10072006.php">posted</a>.  As you might guess, we discussed <a title="Pro Ajax and Java Frameworks" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/15/pro-ajax-and-java-frameworks/">Pro Ajax and Java Frameworks</a> along with a plethora of current events.  If you want a sense of how glamorous writing is, you'll want to give this a listen ;)  Despite some technical glitches (our call dropped a couple of times) a good time was had by all!  Thanks again to ZeroLogik for having us on and before you crank it up, please keep in mind they carry the explicit tag...
