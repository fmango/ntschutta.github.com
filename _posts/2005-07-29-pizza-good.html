I'm sure this won't strike anyone as controversial - heck, most people would call this a no brainer, but man, pizza = good!  Last night my father and I partook of yet another â€œfather-son golf/fishing extravaganzaâ€ tradition by seeing a movie (more on that in a bit) and eating at one of the single greatest pizza joints around: <a href="http://raffertyspizza.com/">Rafferty's</a> in Brainerd.  Frankly, I put Rafferty's in the class of <a href="http://www.svenandoles.com/grandmaraisevents.html">Sven and Ole's</a> in Grand Marais so if you ever find yourself up that way, you owe it to yourself to stop in.  If you are brave enough to venture beyond pepperoni (so that pretty much disqualifies my good friend Ryan!) I highly recommend trying the <a href="http://raffertyspizza.com/menu.html#pizza">Lucky Chicken</a>.  Who knew you could put jelly on pizza?  I don't know what a <a href="http://www.ediblelandscaping.com/Plants/Lingonberry.htm">lingonberry</a> is, but man its tasty on a pizza (and apparently <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_23402,00.html">Swedish Meatballs</a>, who knew?)

Discovering Rafferty's was a happy accident.  On the first incarnation of the â€œfather-son golf/fishing extravaganzaâ€ we decided a movie was the perfect way to escape the oppressive heat (see <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/07/28/golf-in-minnesota-an-ode-to-the-weather/">Golf in Minnesota</a>) since at that point in time our cabin was not blessed with AC.  Anywho, after nearly wetting ourselves watching <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=22037751&trkid=181026">American Pie</a>, we asked the tweanager behind the counter where the nearest pizza joint was.  Of course he spit out Pizza Hut, which is OK but we wanted something local so we pressed on.  Eventually he divulged Rafferty's and our life hasn't been the same since.

Rafferty's now enjoys a treasured spot in the â€œfather-son golf/fishing extravaganzaâ€ line up along with a cold pitcher of <a href="http://www.beersince1933.com/1919rootbeer.htm">1919</a>!  Oh, and if you're in Nisswa, check out that Rafferty's branch there.  If the weather is decent, you really should eat out on the patio.

BTW, we saw <a href="http://www.theweddingcrashers.com/">Wedding Crashers</a> - what a funny movie!  Very worth watching especially the dinner scene...  Joe, you were right, though I'm not quite sure I'd pay full price just for that ten minutes.  I'd give the movie 4 out of 5 stars but be prepared for some juvenile humor.

For those of you that aren't familiar with the premise, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000681/">Vince Vaughn</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005562/">Owen Wilson</a> play a pair of divorce mediators and committed womanizers that make a killing by sneaking into weddings to take advantage of the state weddings put women in.  Of course John (Owen Wilson) falls hard for one special woman (the adorable <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1046097/">Rachel McAdams</a> of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332280/">The Notebook</a> fame) and the rest of the movie more or less revolves around his attempt to woe her from the evil blue blood boyfriend.
