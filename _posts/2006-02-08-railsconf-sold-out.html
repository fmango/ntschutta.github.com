Wow.  RailsConf 2006 is <a href="http://railsconf.org/articles/2006/02/08/railsconf-is-sold-out">sold out</a> - in <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2006/02/08/railsconf-sold-out">less than a week</a>.  Glad <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/06/railsconf-2006/">I didn't wait</a> around...  I'm <strong>*very*</strong> excited to be heading down to this event even though it takes place in prime golfing season!  Guess I might have to check out <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a> too.  When I first read <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html">Rolling with Ruby on Rails</a> I never imagined a year later a conference dedicated to the topic would have sold out in such a short time.  Must have struck a nerve huh?  I was quite pleased to see Jay Zimmerman of <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/index.jsp">No Fluff</a> fame is involved along with <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a>.  I can't say enough good things about NFJS, it really is a great experience.  Check the Tour Stops - chances are it'll be coming your way and if you're in the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=47">Twin Cities</a>, I hope to see you there!
