Clearly I've kicked off a trend - one day, I post about <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/06/21/the-purpose-of-process/">process</a>, a few days later <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Reg Braithwaite</a> coins a <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/07/process-theatre.html">new term</a> and <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">the Daily WTF</a> posts an <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Slaves-to-The-Process.aspx">ode to process</a> ;) . OK, I've only got three readers so I know it's all just a big fat coincidence but still! Process theatre really does capture the notion perfectly; pointy haired bosses believe more templates, meetings and blind adherence to methodology are the answer to failing projects. Of course when you remove all decision making from the hands of sentient beings, you get a lost workday instead of someone just hitting the spacebar.

I'm not anti-process; you've got to have some framework to hang your work on. I plain can't stand dogma though and I thoroughly believe you need to test your processes just as much as you test your code. Is this document/meeting/hurdle saving us money? Resulting in better projects? Happier customers? Whatever the raison d'Ãªtre, we should make sure it's actually delivering. Do more of what works, less of what doesn't. Rinse and repeat.
