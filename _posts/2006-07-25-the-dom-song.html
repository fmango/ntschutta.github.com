I've posted about <a title="Geek Music" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/08/geek-music/">geek music</a> before (and in case you missed it, <a title="My Cubicle" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/19/my-cubicle/">my cubicle</a> is dead on) so when I ran into <a title="Tim Bray's ongoing" href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a>'s <a title="the dom song" href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/21/Nodes">The DOM Song</a>, I just had to put up a link to it!  As someone that has done his fair share of hand to hand combat with the DOM, I found this quite amusing ;)
