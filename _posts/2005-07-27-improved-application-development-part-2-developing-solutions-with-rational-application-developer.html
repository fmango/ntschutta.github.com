My first tutorial for IBM <a href="http://www-130.ibm.com/developerworks/">developerWorks</a> is now available.  Here's the abstract:


<blockquote>In this tutorial, you move from modeling your use cases to building the components of your application. Learn how Rational Application Developer enables you to create class diagrams while generating much of the template code for your components. With this outline in hand, add application-specific implementation code that extends the original model, which you will test in the final part of this tutorial by deploying your code to WebSphere, working through any bugs before moving to more formal testing.

You should really read the <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/i-dw-r-integappl1.html">first tutorial</a> written by <a href="http://mcslp.com/">MC Brown</a> before embarking on mine.
