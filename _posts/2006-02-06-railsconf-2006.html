I've got my ticket to <a href="http://www.railsconf.org/">RailsConf 2006</a>, how about you?  I'm really excited about <a href="http://railsconf.com/pages/guidebook">The Rails Guidebook</a> (I very much wanted to be at the upcoming <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails/index.html">Rails Studio</a>...sigh).  Anyway, I'm trying to get my employer to defray the costs a bit but I just couldn't pass up this opportunity - heck, the <a href="http://www.railsconf.org/pages/keynotes">keynotes</a> alone are worth the price of admission.  Hope to see many of you in Chicago this June (I <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/02/06/railsconf-65-of-the-seats-sold">wouldn't dawdle</a> if I were you)!
