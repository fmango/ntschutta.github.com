Well, we had the big fantasy football draft today and I have to say I'm pretty happy with my team.  Can't say I got everyone I wanted  but its always interesting to see how people draft.  Of course, being Minnesotans, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/players/playerpage/133263">Daunte</a> went <strong>*way*</strong> too soon...  Of course someone jumped on a kicker in an early round and defense went sooner than I expected.  That said, I'm certainly no expert!  Seriously, how did people ever do this before all the cheat sheets?  Well, as much as I want to say "skill" has something to do with it, in my years of playing it all comes down to injuries and luck.  A few years ago I managed to pick some guy named <a href="http://www.nfl.com/players/playerpage/235253">Vick</a> near the end of the draft and I managed to grab the Denver "back of the year" late too.  Its too early to tell what will happen this season but I feel pretty good about my draft.
