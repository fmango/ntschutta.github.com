On Saturday, I had the distinct pleasure of presenting <a title="NFJS FoA talk" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=373">Foundations of Ajax</a> and <a title="NFJS Prag Usability" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=372">Pragmatic Usability</a> at the <a title="NFJS - Iowa" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=58">Central Iowa Software Symposium</a>.  As regular readers know, I've attended <a title="NFJS" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/index.jsp">NFJS</a> events in the past (take a look at my thoughts on this year's MN show: <a title="NFJS day 1" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/17/nfjs-day-1/">day 1</a>, <a title="NFJS day 2" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/20/nfjs-day-2/">day 2</a>, <a title="NFJS day 3" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/22/nfjs-day-3/">day 3</a> and of course <a title="NFJS quotes" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/18/nfjs-quotes/">quotes</a>) but this was my first go at actually presenting.  If you've ever attended a NF event, you know how outstanding the speakers are so I was really honored when <a title="About NFJS" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/about.jsp">Jay Zimmerman</a> gave me the green light!  Based on the feedback I received, I think I held my own which is saying quite a bit when you're sandwiched by the likes of <a title="DH" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=23">David Hussman</a>, <a title="Venkat" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=11">Venkat Subramaniam</a>, <a title="GV" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=17">Glenn Vanderburg</a> and a <a title="speakers" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_speakers.jsp?showId=58">host</a> of outstanding technical minds.

I want to thank everyone that came to my talks - especially those that came up during the breaks to chat!  Unfortunately I wasn't able to stick around for very long (though I thoroughly enjoyed <a title="SD" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=18">Scott Davis</a>' talk on <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=2329&showId=58">Easing into Agile</a> - oh, and thanks to Scott, his mom, and <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=62">Matt</a> for making me feel right at home).   My apologies for the handouts, I will get that corrected (though I know that is of little help to the good folk in Iowa).  For your viewing pleasure, I've uploaded the slides (<a title="FoA slides" href="http://ntschutta.com/slides/Foundations%20of%20Ajax%20NFJS.pdf">FoA</a>, <a title="Prag Usability" href="http://ntschutta.com/slides/Prag%20Usability%20NFJS.pdf">Pragmatic Usability</a>) and as usual these are released under a Creative Commons license.

If you're interested in hearing me present either of these talks, I'll be at the <a title="NFJS - Ohio" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=61">Southern Ohio Software Symposium</a> in two weeks - hope to see you there!
