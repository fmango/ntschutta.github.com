I'm a huge fan of the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> tour (yeah, I know - I could be seen as "biased") and I've wholeheartedly recommended it to many, many people over the years.  For those of you who have (inexplicably) ignored my advice, you can get a flavor of what a typical symposium is like by reading the latest and greatest No Fluff Just Stuff Anthology, Volume II.  That's right, for a low low price, you can have your very own copy of what will, I'm sure, be lauded as one of <strong>*the*</strong> great works of the 21st century (to point, the chapter on usability is top notch!)  But don't just take my word for it, see what <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/index.html">Neal "let's-see-how-many-books-I-can-write-in-one-year" Ford</a> (otherwise known as the cat wrangler of the anthology) has to say <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2007/03/anthologization-redux.html">here</a>.  You can order your very own copy from the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/nfjs07/index.html">Prags</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNo-Fluff-Just-Stuff-Anthology%2Fdp%2F0978739280%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1174156201%26sr%3D8-1&tag=ntschuttacom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Amazon</a> (don't forget, Anthologies make <strong>*great*</strong> gifts).  Enjoy!
