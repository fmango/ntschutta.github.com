<p>I just had to second <a title="Software As" href="http://softwareas.com/">Michael Mahemoff</a>'s <a href="http://softwareas.com/documentation-needs-examples-duh">recent post</a> about examples in documentation.  I really am amazed that examples aren't more widely used - but I'd sure like to see more of it.  It seems so easy...so basic.  But then common sense isn't all that common.
