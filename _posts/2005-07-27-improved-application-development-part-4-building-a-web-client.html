My second tutorial for IBM developerWorks is now available.  Here's the abstract:


<blockquote>
In this tutorial, you'll return to the Auction application that you developed in <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/i-dw-r-integappl2.html">Part 2</a>. You'll add functionality to what you developed previously and connect to your entity beans via a Web-based front end. You'll take advantage of leading-edge technologies like JavaServer Faces (JSF) and Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) to create a dynamic Web project -- and, thanks to IBM Rational Application Developer's powerful Web design features, you'll hardly have to touch the keyboard.
