Now, I'm the first to admit that when I first encountered <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">NetBeans</a> in a training class a few years back I wasn't impressed.  In fact, I thought it was one of the worst tools I'd seen especially given the <strong>*extremely*</strong> detailed instructions the teacher had crafted to avoid all the issues that he (and others) had encountered leading the course.  That said, my opinion has changed 180 degrees since Ryan turned me on to 4.1 (he's a daily build kind of guy) and I've been an advocate since working with it while writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;tag=ntschuttacom-20&#038;creative=9325&#038;path=tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127567332/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a>.

Unfortunately, NetBeans suffers from the EJB 1.0 syndrome - negative first impressions are hard to overcome.  I mean seriously, how many of you identified with Bruce Tate's <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/06/15/ejb3.html">Don't Make me Eat the Elephant Again</a>?  While <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/docs.html">EJB 3.0</a> might be fantastic, I wouldn't bet the farm on its rapid adoption in the corporate world.  Anyway, back to my point.  Today I ran into <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/timboudreau/archive/2006/01/i_thought_id_ne.html">I thought I'd never see the day</a> on <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/timboudreau/">Tim Bourdreau</a>'s blog and <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen?entry=sun_s_tools_are_cool">Sun's Tools are Cool?</a> over on <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen">Roumen</a>'s blog both pointing to <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/">James Governor</a>'s recent post: <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/001203.html">Microsoft Visual Studio Live: Set To Follow Sun's Java Studio Enterprise?</a>

OK, so if you've been around me (or Ryan) for the last several months, you've heard us preach the goodness that is NetBeans.  Seriously, give NetBeans a try, you won't regret it...but don't just take my word for it!
