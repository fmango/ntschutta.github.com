If you're interested in learning a bit more about Ajax, you might want to give <a title="Sang Shin" href="http://www.javapassion.com/SangSchedule.html#Bio">Sang Shin</a>'s <a title="10 week free Ajax course" href="http://www.javapassion.com/ajaxcodecamp/">10 week free Ajax course</a> a try.  The class starts on August 4th - to register, send an email to the Yahoo group he has created.  The schedule looks pretty darn complete though alas, no mention of <a title="Prototype" href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a> or <a title="script.aculo.us" href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us</a>...  Of course if Ajax isn't your thing, take a look at the <a title="Other Courses" href="http://www.javapassion.com/#courses">other courses</a> he teaches.
