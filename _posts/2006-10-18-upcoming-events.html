I've been so busy the last few weeks that I've been remiss in mentioning my schedule.  This weekend I'll be in the Toronto area at the <a title="NFJS" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=73">Greater Toronto Software Symposium</a> talking about <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=3169&showId=73">Ajax</a> and <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=372">usability</a>.  <a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/">Mr. Ashley</a> has been trying to get me to his neck of the woods for a while now, unfortunately I won't be there long enough to soak in the local flavor.  I haven't been speaking much of late so I'm really looking forward to connecting with the lads (I suspect there will be some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlers_of_Catan">Catan</a> going on...)

From there I head over to Boston for the <a href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/show_view.jsp?showId=59">Ajax Experience</a> where I will be presenting a broad overview of some <a href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=307">common Ajax frameworks</a>.  <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/index.jsp">Jay</a> and the <a href="http://ajaxian.com/">Ajaxians</a> have put together a fantastic lineup of speakers and it will be an action packed event.  A few of my friends managed to wrestle some funding from their respective employers so I'm looking forward to catching up.  It's going to be a busy week for me but I'm really excited!
