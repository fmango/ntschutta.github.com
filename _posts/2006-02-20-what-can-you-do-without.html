I've touched on this before, but the next time someone says "<a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/21/what-if/">what if</a> a customer wants to do..." reply <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/it_just_doesnt_matter.php">it just doesn't matter</a>.  The hardest part of software isn't figuring out what the system has to do - it's determining <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/08/cut-the-fat/">what you can do without</a>.  When all else fails, <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/004023.html">keep it simple</a> already (via <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/02/presentation_do.html">Presentation Zen</a>).
