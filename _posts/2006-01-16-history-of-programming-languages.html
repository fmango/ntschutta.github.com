I ran into this great write-up on the <a href="http://dotnetmasters.com/HistoryOfCFamily.htm">History of C languages</a> and its cousin <a href="http://dotnetmasters.com/historyofbasic.htm">History of BASIC</a> on Billy Hollis' blog.  Thanks to Ted Neward for posting <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/01/14/Billy+Hollis+On+The+History+Of+Programming+Languages.aspx">this</a> on <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/default.aspx">The Blog Ride</a> (one of my favorites!)  It's always amusing to look at where languages came from, especially in smart arse sort of way.  Like spoken tongues, programming languages are heavy influenced by each other...
