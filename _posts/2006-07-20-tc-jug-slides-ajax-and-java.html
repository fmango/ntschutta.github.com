Despite the stormy weather last night, Ryan and I had a (nearly) packed house for our talk about Ajax and Java at the <a title="TC JUG" href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JavaUserGroup.aspx">Twin Cities Java User Group</a>.  We had a great time - thanks to everyone that came, we really appreciate the support!  <a title="JJ" href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Instructors/Default.aspx?InstructorID=6">Jeff Jensen</a> was awseome as always (sorry for giving you a bit of heartburn there my man!) and we got some great questions.  Congrats to everyone that won a book or a shirt, enjoy!

For posterity, here are the slides (you can also get them from the TC JUG site).  I added a slide on <a title="Yahoo's UI library" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo's library</a> and there's a special surprise buried in there...
