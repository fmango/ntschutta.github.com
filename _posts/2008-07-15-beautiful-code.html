I don't get to go to quite as many conferences as I'd like but luckily more and more organizers are putting talks on-line or releasing interviews and other useful tidbits. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> is home to a bunch of <a href="http://research.google.com/video.html">Google Tech Talks</a> and the videos from <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/io/">Google I/O</a> are up (take a look at <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve Yegge</a>'s <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/io/server-side-javascript-on-the-java-virtual-machine">Server-side JavaScript on the Java Virtual Machine</a>.) I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> - Sir Ken Robinson's <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">talk on education</a> has been on my iPhone since day one and is a much watch.

Anyway, <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn Vanderburg</a> recently posted a <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/Speaking/jaoo_beauty.rdoc">link</a> to a conversation about <a href="http://blog.jaoo.dk/2008/07/02/what-makes-code-beautiful/">beautiful code</a> recorded at JAOO. The 20-ish minute chat is full of lots of nuggets including a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> reference. Software is much more art than engineering, something that is often lost of the non-technical and <a href="http://www.creativethink.com/">creativity</a> is (rightfully) getting more attention these days. I found myself nodding along throughout, well worth a watch.
