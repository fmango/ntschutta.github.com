I've mentioned this to a few people here and there but mark your calendars for <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com">The Rich Web Experience</a> September 6-8 in San Jose. Whether you're a seasoned Ajax vet or someone that's just trying to get your head around what the heck XHR is, RWE has <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/show_topics.jsp?showId=60">something</a> for you. The <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/show_speakers.jsp?showId=60">lineup</a> looks absolutely fantastic and I'm excited to be a part of the event - if you're interested in going, you can get a $200 discount by using this promotion code: nfjs2007speaker200. I'll be doing an overview of various Ajax libraries, a deep dive on Prototype, and a talk on how to add Ajax to an existing application. Hope to see you there!
