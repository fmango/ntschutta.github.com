Blog time must be like, well, cat years (we don't currently have a dog around the house...) and you've got to love the echo chamber that is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere">blogosphere</a> (have I been <a href="http://digg.com/">Dugg</a> yet? Or is it Digged?). Nearly 48 hours have passed since I talked about <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/16/snap-judgments/">Snap Judgments</a> and two of the blogs I track have commented on the topic (if you visit <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/blink.html">Seth's post</a> you'll see I wasn't the only one to reflect on it!).  First, <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/author/christine/">Christine Perfetti</a> of <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/">UIE</a> chimed in with <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2006/01/18/snap-decisions-on-the-web/">this piece</a> that quotes the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060109/full/060109-13.html">same article</a> Seth did.  However, she provides a bit more depth - and I have to agree with her assessment concerning the implications of the findings.  That said, since reading Don Norman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0465051367%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1137639260%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">Emotional Design</a>, I do think aesthetics matter quite a bit.

The other interesting connection here was from <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a>: <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/your_sites_got_120th_of_a_second_to_make_a_first_impression.php">about how little time you have to make a first impression</a> which commented on <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyid=2006-01-17T203950Z_01_N17291661_RTRUKOC_0_US-SCIENCE-CANADA-WEBSITES.xml&rpc=22">a different article</a> that discusses the study.  So, just in case you didn't notice, people will judge your site (or application) pretty quickly.  As I mentioned in <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/17/sun-tools-out-ahead/">my post on Sun's Tools</a> - first impressions matter and are hard to overcome.  Don't blow it.
