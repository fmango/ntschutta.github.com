Well, this is my very first post - I'm a bit late to the party...  So what do I hope to accomplish?  Mostly, I will ramble about random thoughts on software development but I will probably drone on a bit about other topics as well.

So who am I?  Well, I'm a software engineer from the Twin Cities area of Minnesota with extensive experience in the financial services arena primarily developing J2EE based web applications.  I have a Master of Science in Software Engineering degree from the University of Minnesota and for the last several years, I've focused on user interface design.  I've contributed to corporate interface guidelines and consulted on a variety of web-based applications within my organization.  I believe strongly that if the user canâ€™t figure out your application, youâ€™ve done something wrong.

Along with UI work, I've contributed to two corporate Java frameworks, developed training material, and lead several study groups.  During the brief moments of warm weather found in my home state of Minnesota, I spend as much time on the golf course as my wife will tolerate.  I'm currently exploring Ruby, Rails and after recently making the switch, Mac OS X.

I've been heavily influenced by the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a> and <a href="http://www.jnd.org/">Don Norman</a>.  I'm pretty sure <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> is one of the smartest people around.  I think <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax</a> is a huge stride forward and will make the web a much better platform for applications.

OK, that's good for now - heck I'm on vacation this week!  For now, be well.
