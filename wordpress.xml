		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, this is my very first post - I'm a bit late to the party...  So what do I hope to accomplish?  Mostly, I will ramble about random thoughts on software development but I will probably drone on a bit about other topics as well.

So who am I?  Well, I'm a software engineer from the Twin Cities area of Minnesota with extensive experience in the financial services arena primarily developing J2EE based web applications.  I have a Master of Science in Software Engineering degree from the University of Minnesota and for the last several years, I've focused on user interface design.  I've contributed to corporate interface guidelines and consulted on a variety of web-based applications within my organization.  I believe strongly that if the user canâ€™t figure out your application, youâ€™ve done something wrong.

Along with UI work, I've contributed to two corporate Java frameworks, developed training material, and lead several study groups.  During the brief moments of warm weather found in my home state of Minnesota, I spend as much time on the golf course as my wife will tolerate.  I'm currently exploring Ruby, Rails and after recently making the switch, Mac OS X.

I've been heavily influenced by the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a> and <a href="http://www.jnd.org/">Don Norman</a>.  I'm pretty sure <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> is one of the smartest people around.  I think <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax</a> is a huge stride forward and will make the web a much better platform for applications.

OK, that's good for now - heck I'm on vacation this week!  For now, be well.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My first tutorial for IBM <a href="http://www-130.ibm.com/developerworks/">developerWorks</a> is now available.  Here's the abstract:


<blockquote>In this tutorial, you move from modeling your use cases to building the components of your application. Learn how Rational Application Developer enables you to create class diagrams while generating much of the template code for your components. With this outline in hand, add application-specific implementation code that extends the original model, which you will test in the final part of this tutorial by deploying your code to WebSphere, working through any bugs before moving to more formal testing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My second tutorial for IBM developerWorks is now available.  Here's the abstract:


<blockquote>
In this tutorial, you'll return to the Auction application that you developed in <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/i-dw-r-integappl2.html">Part 2</a>. You'll add functionality to what you developed previously and connect to your entity beans via a Web-based front end. You'll take advantage of leading-edge technologies like JavaServer Faces (JSF) and Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) to create a dynamic Web project -- and, thanks to IBM Rational Application Developer's powerful Web design features, you'll hardly have to touch the keyboard.

		<title>Golf in Minnesota - an Ode to the Weather</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Minnesota weather is, well, weird.  I know, some of you are thinking we have permafrost and it never gets above 50 but I swear, that's just not true.  In fact most of July has been hot - not Arizona hot, but still toasty warm.  And for those of you that have heard a Minnesotan say of our winters "its a dry cold" well this time of year we get plenty of humidity.

We've had <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/product.php?site=mpx&title=Public+Information+Statement&product=PNSMPX.0507162227&format=">quite a string of 90 degree days</a> so it was with this streak in mind that I packed my bag for the annual "father-son golf/fishing extravaganza" this week at the family cabin (its almost the law around here - everyone has a family cabin.)  I brought plenty of shorts, extra golf shirts, lots of light colors...everything you need to play a few rounds when the temperatures are in the 90s.   But this is Minnesota and the one truth about our weather is that it changes, often very quickly.  So imagine my surprise when it was around 50 degrees when we teed off at <a href="http://www.golfgoldeneagle.com/">Golden Eagle</a> on Tuesday.  OK so I wasn't really surprised per-say but I wasn't prepared so I had to buy a fleece from the pro shop (it is MN after all - they even had winter hats and gloves.)

Another oddity about our weather is the rain.  For some reason, we always seem to have a bunch of rain in the Spring then we have near droughts during the summer.  This year held to form - we had a ton of rain early and then July hit and the spigots turned off.  It has hardly rained during all of July until, of course, this week.  This is the sixth incarnation of the "father-son golf/fishing extravaganza" and in five years we haven't had a single round impaired by rain.  Sure, we had some drizzles, but nothing that drove us off the course.

That streak ended this week.  On Monday we played Golden Eagle with my cousin, Gerald (he and his wife came up to the cabin for a couple of days).  Gerald is also my <a href="http://www.golfonline.com/golfonline/instruction/teachers/top100/0,,59,00.html">golf instructor</a> and he's a good stick.  Because we are such fans of Golden Eagle we were really jazzed to show him this North Woods gem.  Things were going great...until about the 7th hole.  By the time we made the turn it was pouring so we huddled in the club house.  According to the radar it was going to be an all day rain.  Sigh.  Our first raincheck in 6 years.

Oh well, losing half a round, it happens, this is the real world.  Dad and I went back to Golden Eagle on Tuesday and got 18 in (with a nice warm fleece) and we figured we were good for the rest of the week.  We had a tee time at <a href="http://www.maddens.com/page/174-5661.htm">The Classic at Madden's</a> on Wednesday with one of my father's friends and his brother.  We arrived to absolutely gorgeous weather - temps in the mid 70s, blue sky, a bit windy but ideal golfing weather.  Things were going great until about the 6th hole when I noticed clouds off in the distance.  By 10 we started hearing some thunder, nothing ominous but still something to think about.  By 13 we saw lightening and we bolted for the clubhouse.  As we were putting the sticks in the truck, the sky opened up and we got drenched.  Sigh.  Another rain check.

Oh well, that's Minnesota and that's golf.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Pizza = good</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm sure this won't strike anyone as controversial - heck, most people would call this a no brainer, but man, pizza = good!  Last night my father and I partook of yet another â€œfather-son golf/fishing extravaganzaâ€ tradition by seeing a movie (more on that in a bit) and eating at one of the single greatest pizza joints around: <a href="http://raffertyspizza.com/">Rafferty's</a> in Brainerd.  Frankly, I put Rafferty's in the class of <a href="http://www.svenandoles.com/grandmaraisevents.html">Sven and Ole's</a> in Grand Marais so if you ever find yourself up that way, you owe it to yourself to stop in.  If you are brave enough to venture beyond pepperoni (so that pretty much disqualifies my good friend Ryan!) I highly recommend trying the <a href="http://raffertyspizza.com/menu.html#pizza">Lucky Chicken</a>.  Who knew you could put jelly on pizza?  I don't know what a <a href="http://www.ediblelandscaping.com/Plants/Lingonberry.htm">lingonberry</a> is, but man its tasty on a pizza (and apparently <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_23402,00.html">Swedish Meatballs</a>, who knew?)

Discovering Rafferty's was a happy accident.  On the first incarnation of the â€œfather-son golf/fishing extravaganzaâ€ we decided a movie was the perfect way to escape the oppressive heat (see <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/07/28/golf-in-minnesota-an-ode-to-the-weather/">Golf in Minnesota</a>) since at that point in time our cabin was not blessed with AC.  Anywho, after nearly wetting ourselves watching <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=22037751&trkid=181026">American Pie</a>, we asked the tweanager behind the counter where the nearest pizza joint was.  Of course he spit out Pizza Hut, which is OK but we wanted something local so we pressed on.  Eventually he divulged Rafferty's and our life hasn't been the same since.

Rafferty's now enjoys a treasured spot in the â€œfather-son golf/fishing extravaganzaâ€ line up along with a cold pitcher of <a href="http://www.beersince1933.com/1919rootbeer.htm">1919</a>!  Oh, and if you're in Nisswa, check out that Rafferty's branch there.  If the weather is decent, you really should eat out on the patio.

BTW, we saw <a href="http://www.theweddingcrashers.com/">Wedding Crashers</a> - what a funny movie!  Very worth watching especially the dinner scene...  Joe, you were right, though I'm not quite sure I'd pay full price just for that ten minutes.  I'd give the movie 4 out of 5 stars but be prepared for some juvenile humor.

For those of you that aren't familiar with the premise, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000681/">Vince Vaughn</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005562/">Owen Wilson</a> play a pair of divorce mediators and committed womanizers that make a killing by sneaking into weddings to take advantage of the state weddings put women in.  Of course John (Owen Wilson) falls hard for one special woman (the adorable <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1046097/">Rachel McAdams</a> of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332280/">The Notebook</a> fame) and the rest of the movie more or less revolves around his attempt to woe her from the evil blue blood boyfriend.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm not sure why I feel compelled to write this, but its my blog and I'll do what I want to.  I've had plenty of people wonder, out loud, why I could possibly live in this (often) frozen state.  Of course I'm convinced many people think Minnesota has snow 9 months out of the year - and I tell ya, it just ain't so!

Anyway, this past weekend was filled with reminders of why I live here.  On Friday night, while my wife and I sat by the fire (yes, we roasted marshmallows and ate s'mores) one of the loons on our lake <a href="http://www.ns.ec.gc.ca/wildlife/loons/sounds/trem.wav">called out</a> to its mate.  For those of you that haven't heard a <a href="http://www.ns.ec.gc.ca/wildlife/loons/sounds/wail.au">loon call echo across a lake</a> in person, I'm not nearly the writer required to express the feelings that sound evokes.

On Saturday, my wife and I went fishing (hey, we are Minnesotans after all!) and twenty five feet of our bow, one of the loons was paddling along.  One hundred feet from the loon the eagle that calls our lake home was looking for a little breakfast.  That evening, the loon family floated just off our dock.
<img src="http://www.ntschutta.com/images/loon%20family.png" alt="loon family" width="350" height="250"/>

I'll admit there are days (OK weeks) in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/best/bplive/topten/coldest.html">January</a> and February where I really do question my sanity.  However, weekends like the last one in July remind me why I call this wonderful state home.  Besides, it really is nice to have <a href="http://education.umn.edu/MN/weather.html">four seasons</a>!  I mean how boring must San Diego be?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It started so subtly, I almost didn't even notice.  The other night, my wife and I were watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183790/">A Knight's Tale</a>, the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005132/">Heath Ledger</a> tour de force.  While this movie didn't sweep the Oscars, it is still entertaining and features a pretty darn good soundtrack - I mean, how can you not like <a href="http://www.queenonline.com/">Queen's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002M5U88/002-1104756-7344839?v=glance">We Will Rock You</a>?  So we're watching one of the scenes with a heavy Queen backdrop and next thing I know, my foot is a tappin.

My subconscious is a much better dancer than I (one shudders to think what our first dance would have been like but for my wife's uncanny ability to keep time) but the involuntary flailing of my clodhopper got me thinking about rhythm.  My own ineptitude combined with watching <a href="http://www.ernieels.com/">Ernie Els</a> for five minutes proves how key rhythm is to golf...but its everywhere if you just look.  The seasons have their own beat - days get longer and shorter, nights get cooler, mornings warmer.  Think back to school, a new semester, a break, a new semester, a longer break!

What really interests me though, is how the idea of rhythm applies to developing software.  Projects have a natural rhythm and when you get it right, it really is something.  I remember back when - our project had achieved velocity and we fell into our rhythm.  We were delivering code every two to three weeks and we where having a blast.  Without a doubt, it was the most fun I've ever had developing software.

Compare that to the proverbial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_%28software_development%29">death march</a>.  Try dancing to that beat.  Does it work?  Did you enjoy it?  On your next project, think about rhythm and think about what it feels like when everyone is keeping the same time.  Its effortless.  It flows.  its fun.]]></content:encoded>

To be successful, you&#8217;ve got to chunk the goal up and celebrate the baby steps! Software isn&#8217;t any different. Finish that cool new Ajax widget? Great, bring in some pie!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, we've been practicing what I like to call "project archeology."  Almost four years ago, I joined my current team to work on a rewrite of an old IMS/CICS based accounting system.  We were designing a new data model, switching to DB2, and moving to a web based user interface courtesy of Java.  Things were really cranking along until our senior executives do what they do best: they announced a "merger of equals."  Needless to say, our world hasn't been the same since.

During integration (and some would argue its still going on) my project was essentially on hold.  For quite some time, it sure seemed like my project would whither on the vine but for reasons that aren't entirely clear, its back.  Over the course of the year and a half that was integration, a number of things have changed - we've got new management and several team members have moved on.  But as I said in an earlier post, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/06/abandon-all-hope-of-a-better-past/">abandon all hope for a better past</a>.

So what does that have to do with project archeology?  Our new PM is going through all of our old documents trying to answer two very interesting questions: what did we promise our customers and what do we have left to deliver.  While its hard to answer the later without knowing the former, we really have a firmer hold on what's left than what the target is/was.  Anyway, its been quite fascinating to peer back and try to remember what someone might have meant by "Foo feature must perform better" (a real "requirement") and figure out what features might have been tested.

But what does this have to do with formality?  Over the years, my company has used a number of different methodologies with all the requisite templates and forms.  Now, I never really knew what any of these documents were supposed to prove other than methodologists are the cockroaches of IS - you just can't kill them.  Seriously, it doesn't matter how many reorganizations a shop goes through, they just don't die.  The tend to change names a lot though...  OK, enough of that rant.  I have to admit, I wasn't on the project when much of what we are now dissecting was written, but it sure looks to me like all the "process" we followed at the time is doing much to help us today.

As I was sitting in a project meeting last week, I was reflecting on the difficulty we are having piecing our past back together and I was wondering if a greater level of formality would have helped our project.  A friend works at a shop that is actively seeking <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/presentations/sepg03.presentations/transition-levels.pdf">CMMI level 3</a> and my first reaction was - why?  I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html">agile approaches</a> since they seem best positioned to deal with the inevitable change of software (and I can't help but like the <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/crystal/articles/cpanfocisd/characterizingpeopleasnonlinear.html">importance of people</a> in these processes.)  But you know what?  After a few months (don't ask) figuring out where we are and where we were trying to get to, I'm starting to wonder what the right level of formality is on a software project.

I don't have any answers but I sure do have some questions!  What affect does company culture have on the need for formality?  Does the type of application matter?  What's the right level of formality?  I'm not ready to run out and champion CMMI at my employer, but next time I join a project "in the beginning" I think I might try and impose a tad more discipline.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good write up!

"What affect does company culture have on the need for formality?"  I think that has a LOT to do with the need for formality.  Some companies have a real CYA culture where its more about proving you did what you were told to do rather than solving the right problem the right way.  Obviously in a culture like that having tons of formality allows everyone prove they followed the "letter of the law."  Regardless, its tough to be sucessful in that environment.  In a culture of "trust" (IMHO) it is easier to adopt less formality.

"Does the type of application matter? Whatâ€™s the right level of formality?"  I'm sure it matters in some cases, but I don't think its the significant factor.  Instead I think it has more to do with the team and how it wants to work.  Both Alistair Cockburn and The Pragmatic Programmers believe that your process (and thus the "level of formality") should taliored to individual teams/projects adopting appropriate aspects of agility.  I think the hardest thing is that experts always say "it depends" leaving you to figure out the right balance. 

"Iâ€™m not ready to run out and champion CMMI at my employer"  I hope not! ;-)

"I think I might try and impose a tad more discipline."  Discipline and formality are orthogonal.   Most agile processes stress discipline.

I think the more interesting question is:  After 18 months and a merger, are your requirements still the same?  Is the project's business case unchanged?  If the answer is "yes" then I would say for your project... formality could be useful because you have very static requirements.

If not, I'd say... get the code building, grab some high priority user stories and write tests to prove that the feature is complete/there (green bar done! ) or needs to be developed.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[John - couldn't agree more.  Culture is so key (and you and I have some shared history there!)  The longer I develop software, the more I realize that people are by far the most important piece of the equation.  Sure, you can have the best tools, the fastest computers...if you've got average people you'll wind up with average software.  I think its interesting that the people who know the least about agile call it undisciplined when in my mind, there's more structure in a well run agile project than most of the fire fights I've been on!

Oh, by the way, my project has over 1400 tests - maybe that's not much but we've only got about 600 Java classes.  Needless to say, I like JUnit!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I definitely agree with you Nate.  Obviously certain managers (*cough*) think everyone is plug and play.  Its easy on a high performing team to say that all this overhead/process slows people down because we are disciplined enough to manage ourselves.  But what do you think about a less experienced or not as talented staff?  Does the BDUF and LOTS of process work better for these types of teams?  Is there a relationship between the abilities of a team and the amount of process necessary?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, I'd argue you're always better off with the best people you can find but certainly, if you have a bunch of average or below average performers, process and planning can help.  Frankly, I think that's part of what *cough* we're seeing these days...and of course you can always ask yourself "why would people want to surround themselves with average?"  Truth be told, coaches, managers, etc. can only do so much to improve a good team, however, there is no limit to the damage they can cause any team.  The problem with using planning and process in lieu of quality people: you get what you "pay for."  In other words, if you treat people like imbeciles that have to be told *exactly* what to do at all times that is exactly what you'll get.  But then that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.  Given the choice, I'll take high quality people over any process.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A lot of us have a tendency to focus on the past - its easy to see where we've been.  After all not one of us truly knows what tomorrow will bring (sometimes even this afternoon is a challenge) but looking back is a breeze.  I think all of us have wanted to pull a Superman and turn back time but life just doesn't have an undo button.

I had a 1-1 with my VP the other day and during it he said "Abandon all hope of a better past."  At first glance, this quote may sound a tad dark but truthfully I think there's a lesson here.  True, we all wish we could fix the past but in the end, that's just wishful thinking.  That doesn't mean we should ignore history but to expend enormous amounts of energy in an effort to somehow improve it is not particularly fruitful.  But just because we can't change the past doesn't mean we shouldn't try to learn the lessons it has to teach.

So remember, we are where we are; there's little we can do to change how we got here.  However, we do control our present and our future so if there are things in your past that you wish you could change put your effort into the things that are in your hands.  Learn from the past but don't let it consume you.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many have claimed that Apple's <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=aapl">recent stock performance</a> is largely due to the amazing popularity of their ubiquitous <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/70803/wo/nb3FpVfjU6z32DW3uIQAcpRYYqO/0.0.11.1.0.6.15.0.1.1.3.0.1.1.1.1.0">iPods</a> and the "<a href="http://www.macobserver.com/article/2004/11/24.3.shtml">Halo Effect</a>" this is having as <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/business/20050504-085829-1155r.htm">people purchase Macs</a> to go with their music players.  I'm no economist but I should have known something was up when my dad bought himself an iPod a couple of Christmases ago (oh if I would have picked up some Apple shares then!)  I held out - sure, iPods are trendy and lots of my friends have them but I just didn't listen to enough music to justify the cost.  Well, today I broke down and joined the masses.

<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/08/an_ipod_sheep_f.html">Am I a sheep</a>?  I don't think so, but I'm happy to be in the flock as it were.  If there is such a thing as the "Halo Effect" I think I'm part of it but not in the way you would expect.  You see, a few months back I bought a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html">15" PowerBook</a>.  I'll write more about why I switched soon but frankly, that purchase spurred me on to get an iPod.  I suppose that's backwards, but then most of the things I do are!

Of course the "real" reason I bought an iPod had to do with photos (I bought a <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/72601/wo/U86P8lFCrtHY3cMOcznBI47ZJYr/2.0.0.11.1.0.6.9.1.1.1.1.2.0.0.1.0">20 GB</a> now that they are all color) more specifically our upcoming trip to Spain.  While I have a 512 MB chip for our nifty digital camera, I didn't want to deal with deleting photos or shooting at lower resolutions.  Sure, I could have just purchased more memory cards but what fun would that be?  Anyway, I'll let you (yes, all two of you) know what I think as I start to play with this new toy but so far so good!  That said, the ear buds aren't so great - if you have any advice on good replacements (that don't cost more than the iPod itself) I'm all ears!]]></content:encoded>

For those of you that haven't tried NetBeans lately, you really need to...  Honeslty, given the choice, I would take an OS X machine for development over anything else (unless of course, I had to do .NET stuff!)  Anyway, my "Why a Mac" entry is coming, I promise!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm still waiting for a day when I can just run into Best Buy and buy OS X and run it on my PC.  I promise its not that far away.  

It's simply a matter of economics.  Apple has made the price of entry into their world so much higher than say Windows to Linux, that its not practical for most people to make the switch.  Instead of costing me $150 to try out OS X, it will cost me over $1000 because I have to buy the computer too.  For cheapskates like me that will take me a while to get in to.  I'll let you know when I get one!]]></wp:comment_content>

Of course I'd argue that, at least with my PowerBook, and extra I paid was worth it and I can only think that Intel based machines would be cheaper...  You could argue that Apple is really a consumer electronics company these days with the iPod making up such a large share of the revenue.]]></wp:comment_content>

Back in late August I broke down and bought an iPod - mostly for our trip to Spain - and now we have video iPods. When I first heard rumors about watching a movie or TV show on an iPod, I had to admit I was skeptical. Well, I guess I should know better than to do doubt - Apple has sold more than a million videos in less than 20 days despite a rather limited content. [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

Now, I&#8217;ll admit, I was late to this whole iPod thing but I have to tell you, I find podcasts really interesting.

Frankly, I don&#8217;t listen to that much music but I&#8217;m digging podcasts especially while I&#8217;m working out. I used to try to read a book or a magazine but never again - it&#8217;s just much easier to listen to something and with the quality of the podcasts out there I can learn a ton. Anyway, two of my favorite blogs commented on iPods and the Olympics and I just had to chime in. First, Clive Thompson, over at collision detection posted Do iPods help Olympic athletes perform better? where he points to an article from the Baltimore Sun. A little while later I ran into Kathy Sierra&#8217;s post iPods increase performance? which talks about the same article but also references this New York Times piece (interestingly, Clive and Kathy posted within 20 minutes of each other).

		<title>Agile Methods vs. Interaction Design</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm a UI guy (not that you can tell that by this website mind you) - the vast majority of my development experience has been on "the front end" and I consider myself a usability guy.  Sure, I'm not classically trained, I don't have PhD (yet) but I'm a longtime member of <a href="http://www.acm.org/">ACM</a>'s <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigchi/">SIGCHI</a> and for a while I belonged to the <a href="http://www.upassoc.org/">UPA</a> (which I plan on getting back into now actually.)  In my experience, you can have the most technically perfect domain model connected to a finely tuned database but if you're UI sucks, so does your product.

I also think that most software projects would be FAR more successful if they spent just a few hours watching their users do their actual jobs.  Too often, I've been involved in projects where a manager or supervisor would tell us what their people needed to do their jobs...and I don't need to tell you they were almost always wrong.  A few days of <a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/prototyping_tips/">paper prototyping</a> with some real users is a investment that pays dividends (unless they decide to write all over your prototype with red pen but that's a blog for another day!)

Anyway, I'm pretty sure that <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> methodologies are the best way to develop software.  Inevitably, requirements change and the ability to deliver working code regularly works.  Most customers aren't able to think as abstractly as most programmers so actually seeing something real will get you much closer to meeting their needs than months of requirements gathering.  Beyond the fact I think it works better, I particularly like the importance placed on people in Agile methodologies.

Of course I've never been in a position to truly work in an Agile way (despite the recent buzzword bonanza at my current employer) but I've always wondered, how does the UI fit into Agile?  More to the point, what about Interaction Design?  Well, I ran into this very interesting <a href="http://www.fawcette.com/interviews/beck_cooper/default.asp">article/interview</a> between <a href="http://www.cooper.com/">Alan Cooper</a> (author of one of my favorite books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672326140/qid=1125161858/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-9545684-1908916?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">The Inmates are Running the Asylum</a>) and <a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/">Kent Beck</a> ("father" of XP and co-creator of <a href="http://www.junit.org/index.htm">JUnit</a>) - quite a fun read!  More often than not, they agree and I think they would make a formidable pair leading a development project but they have some significant disagreements.  Anyhow, good read.

What do you think?  How do you agile user interface design?  Can you?  Can't we all just get along?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight my good friend Linnea tied the knot!  It was a gorgeous summer day (I told you we had a few) and we had a wonderful time.  The ceremony was surprisingly short for a full blown Catholic wedding (I'm a recovering Catholic myself with a dozen years of uniforms and nuns under my belt.)  The church and the hall were great; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Minneapolis">Northeast</a> has really seen quite a revitalization!  The food was excellent and it was really great catching up with my friends Molly (I'm jealous of your new car!), Andrea, Christine (aka Elder) and Derek.  I just don't get to see enough of you all!

I'm really happy for Linnea and Curtis - I wish you two a lifetime of happiness!]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[[...] With the third anniversary of our wedding coming up next week, I was struck by a phrase I heard while planning our nuptials: October is the New June. We love the fall hence part of our attraction for the date but it was clear even then that more and more people were getting married as the leaves turned. Well, last night, we celebrated the marriage of my good friend Christine (aka Elder) to long time beau Derek! It was just an idyllic day - temps were in the mid 60s with a ton of sunshine - frankly the kind of day we had hoped for back in 2002. Anyway, it was great to catch up with old friends like Linnea, Curtis, Althea, and Tom (Al and Tom are getting married next weekend - see, everyone wants a fall wedding but still, I like to think Christine and helped popularize the date!) Elder was gorgeous and the Woman&#8217;s Club of Minneapolis is a great spot for a reception, great location, very intimate setting. I&#8217;d never been a wedding at the Basilica but it was fantastic! [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, Christine and I just returned from our annual pilgrimage to the "<a href="http://www.mnstatefair.org/">Great Minnesota Get Together</a>" and we had a blast!  We broke with tradition and went on a Sunday afternoon (we're more of a "Friday early" family) but we had a good reason.  You see, my wife's current favorite group (note, I didn't say band - I've learned that lesson by now) <a href="http://www.tonicsolfa.com/">Tonic Sol-Fa</a> was giving a free concert at the bandshell so, well, we just had to be there.  Of course I think my wife mostly just wanted to stare at the bass, Jared.  Anyway, the lads put on a terrific show - if you have a chance to see them, I whole heartedly recommend them.  I was disappointed they didn't play my favorite, Grace, from their current CD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0009K7RQG/qid=1125290297/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-9545684-1908916?v=glance&s=music&n=507846">Boston to Beijing</a>.  Such is life!

As one would expect, there was more <a href="http://gopher.mnstatefair.org/foodfinder/">food</a> than you could shake a stick at (and, surprise, most of it was available on a stick) and we ate most of it including all the usual suspects:
<ul>
	<li>corn dogs</li>
	<li>french fries (from the stand across from the midway of course)</li>
	<li>cheese curds (from the one true source in the Food Building)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.citypages.com/bestof2002/citygritty/bestof1564.asp">Sweet Martha's Cookies</a> (gotta get these at the giant booth next to the Grandstand)</li>
	<li>all you can drink milk (now a buck - man, I remember 75 cents, 50, even 25 cents...I know Dad, it used to cost, what a nickel?)</li>
	<li>chocolate shakes from the Dairy Barn (something about drinking a dairy product while watching a cow being milked...but then I grew up around critters)</li>
	<li>the ubiquitous mini doughnuts</li>
</ul>

Good times!  We even ventured off the well worn path that is our "Fair eating plan."  Every year, a dozen or so new products comes on the scene.  In years past it was deep fried candy bars and then deep fried Twinkees (are you sensing a trend here?  Put food on stick...deep fry food...sell for $4...repeat.)  This year we tried:
<ul>
	<li>grilled chocolate sandwiches (seriously, it sounded good...wait, now that I think about it...not really.)  Seriously, skip it.</li>
	<li>spaghetti and meat ball on a stick (told you we could put <strong>*any*</strong> food on a stick.)  Not bad, but don't feel bad if you didn't try this one.  If it were a dollar cheaper I might have a different opinion.</li>
	<li>chocolate dipped potato chips.  Haven't tried these yet but they sure look interesting...</li>
</ul>

Of course we also brought home a few things including a "rice kristie bar" and various nut products.  Hey, you just haven't lived until you had cinnamon sugar coated almonds!

The Fair is always a bitter sweet time for me.  I really enjoy going (and eating!) but it has always stood as a sign that summer is over.  Don't get me wrong, I love the fall but that also means we're not that far from snow...  Sigh.  Oh well, we had fun!  And for those of you that don't go every year?  Why the heck not?  Couple of fun fair facts (going by memory here - couldn't find anything online.)  Ours is the second largest fair in the country to Texas (though theirs lasts a month, ours less than 2 weeks) and each day, the Fairgrounds becomes the third largest city in the state.  I know, its corny, but I really do love the Fair!  Well, that closes the door on another fair experence...until next year!]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[[...] In my mind, the State Fair truly marks the end of summer, but yesterday was officially the end. Well, fall officially started just a few minutes ago but for those of you that think good old MN is frozen, we nearly hit 90 yesterday. What a wild ride last-night&#8217;s storms were - I hope all in the local viewing area came through OK&#8230; In light of Katrina (soon to be joined by Rita) it&#8217;s really minor but still, enough to cause problems. My old HS was shut down as was my parents&#8217; district and talking to my (new) coworkers, some folks had quite a bit of damage. We had nearly 2.5 inches of rain here but luckily no damage. Sigh. Today was one of those &#8220;ideal fall days.&#8221; Shorts and a sweatshirt in the morning (and yes, I can actually wear shorts to the office now!) by the afternoon, a cool dry 67 degrees right now!

		<title>The State Fair Part 2</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Couple of comments I forgot to put in yesterday's piece.  First, the "<a href="http://www.stthomas.edu/">evil empire</a>" was doing some serious campaign work at the Fair - I saw tons of their bags all over the place.  Second, if you're planning on seeing Tonic Sol-Fa at next year's fair (assuming they are still playing at the free bandshell - you would expect they will eventually move up the Grandstand) you best get their early.  We got there around 6:40 (nearly two hours before the scheduled start time) and we had a tough time finding good seats.  Apparently the word is getting out on these guys.  I have to admit, I was quite surprised at the variety I saw in their audience.  As you would expect, there was a strong showing in the key 18-35 demo but I was really shocked at how many people in the 50s, 60s and 70s I saw there.  Actually, it was the guy in the "I Love You Man" Bud Light T-shirt (how long ago was that campaign?) that really seemed out of place...

While I'm talking about Tonic Sol-Fa yet again I do have to point out that they are based from (what I consider) my home town of St. Cloud and half the boys hail from my <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/">alma matter</a>!  Go Johnnies!

Few other random thoughts.  First, its been a long time since I've gone to the Fair and night and its really quite fun!  It helps to have such unbelievably good weather the last few days.  The place really thins out around 7 which gives you some room to move.  Speaking of which, those of you with the SUV sized strollers, seriously, they just can't fit everywhere.  We don't have kids so maybe I'll feel differently in the future (and the way Christine talks, that future isn't going to be very far off.)  Still, watching people try and maneuver these massive kid carriers around was pretty frustrating.  Of course the people with the massive kid backpacks - you might want to be careful when you turn - you're a bit larger than you're used to.

You know, people are pretty interesting.  With 130,000 folks around, you'd think people would realize they, you know, aren't alone.  Its one thing to walk around absentmindedly, but to the guy that was walking backwards down the street - yeah, not a good idea!  Anyway, we had a great time (don't mind my comments, I can be a crank sometimes) and the weather really was outstanding!  For now, we'll just munch on our leftover Sweet Martha's Cookies.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been doing this whole "web thing" long enough to remember the good old days of "this site optimized for Internet Explorer" or something similar.  Recently, I've even run into sites that complain about <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> but, that's somewhat understandable.  As a newbie Mac user I've seen some issues in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari</a> though by and large everything works as I would expect.  And, as someone that has played around a lot with <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax</a>, I know too well the issues of cross browser JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

Still, I was absolutely stunned by this article: "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/24/AR2005082401988.html">Copyright Program to Require Explorer</a>."  Now, read carefully, it does say the <a href="http://www.siebel.com/">Siebel Systems</a> wouldn't <em>guarantee</em> there forms would work in another browser (in my mind implying they actually might) but still, to require one browser these days?  I know its not quite the same, but what would happen if <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> decided to that?  Very odd decision if you ask me.  Seriously, how hard could it be?  What are they doing that is <strong>so</strong> much harder than say, <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>?]]></content:encoded>

Wow, what the heck is going on here? I can see something like &#8220;must use modern browsers&#8221; but you *must* use IE 6? Here&#8217;s the Computerworld article on it as well as some responses from Paul Murphy and a somewhat related piece by David Berlind. Frankly, FEMA is pretty busy these days so I&#8217;m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they were just trying to get something up fast so people could start applying for the aid they desperately need. Of course with the general lack of power in that area, I suspect most people will use other means to contact FEMA&#8230; [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, we had the big fantasy football draft today and I have to say I'm pretty happy with my team.  Can't say I got everyone I wanted  but its always interesting to see how people draft.  Of course, being Minnesotans, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/players/playerpage/133263">Daunte</a> went <strong>*way*</strong> too soon...  Of course someone jumped on a kicker in an early round and defense went sooner than I expected.  That said, I'm certainly no expert!  Seriously, how did people ever do this before all the cheat sheets?  Well, as much as I want to say "skill" has something to do with it, in my years of playing it all comes down to injuries and luck.  A few years ago I managed to pick some guy named <a href="http://www.nfl.com/players/playerpage/235253">Vick</a> near the end of the draft and I managed to grab the Denver "back of the year" late too.  Its too early to tell what will happen this season but I feel pretty good about my draft.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Farewell Casey, Farewell</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was a tough day.  Oh sure, I've been a developer long enough (heck, I've been alive long enough) to realize that the only constant is change but that didn't make today any easier.  Today, a good friend said goodbye and while I know I'll see him and his family again soon, and despite the fact that I've known it was coming for several months it still hurt to say farewell.

I've worked with Casey for almost four years now and I have to admit, tomorrow is going to be really strange.  It didn't help that a contractor literally moved into his cube as he was leaving (such is the corporate world) but I really don't know what to expect when I walk by in the morning and he's not there.

I won't get into anything "mushy" here (did enough of that in person today) but there is one thing I will add here.  Casey - thanks for the compliments about my teaching ability but I want to thank you for being such a good student.  Thanks for asking questions!  Without great students, there can be no great teachers - thanks for making my job so darn enjoyable for the last four years!

I'm a "quote of the day" kind of guy so its no surprise that in times like this, I'm turning to someone else's words.  I have a feeling I'll be repeating this to myself quite a bit over the next few weeks:


<blockquote>
"Don't be dismayed at goodbyes, a farewell is necessary before you can meet again and meeting again, after moments or lifetimes, is certain for those who are friends."
	Richard Bach</blockquote>



To Casey, Julia and Gunny, I wish you all the best on you're grand adventure; you'll do great and we're really happy for you!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[These days, everyone is busy. Sites like <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> have plenty of <a href="http://www.43folders.com/topics/productivity">posts</a> dedicated to ways to make you more <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/productivity/">productive</a>. And while <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">Getting Things Done</a> is certainly important, many have forgotten the importance of slack. We've all been given stretch goals but maybe that's <a href="http://blog.toolshed.com/2007/12/are-you-working.html">not the answer</a>. None other than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> recommends having spare capacity:



<blockquote>“You must always work not just within but below your means. If you can handle three elements, handle only two. If you can handle ten, then handle five. In that way the ones you do handle, you handle with more ease, more mastery and you create a feeling of strength in reserve.”
</blockquote>


I wonder what would happen if fewer of us were <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/so_it_takes_les.html">juggling multiple projects</a>, if instead we had some time to <a href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2008/01/_one_of_the_bro.html">let our minds wander</a>. Love him or hate him, Bill Gates is a darn smart dude and his contributions to technology can't be denied. Frankly, many of us could benefit from something akin to his <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB111196625830690477-IZjgYNklaB4o52sbHmIa62Im4.html">think weeks</a> though I'm sure few (if any) companies would ever sponsor such a thing for mere rank and file employees. Oh wait, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/static.py?page=about.html">Google</a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/googles-20-percent-time-in-action.html">does</a>.

Manufacturing plants don't constantly run their assembly lines at red line - to do so would cause costly breakdowns. Yet we're constantly rushing to fix bugs or slap in that much needed feature and right or wrong, some people (heck some entire companies) thrive on a heroic "fire fighting" approach. But repeated use of tactical solutions guarantees a heaping pile of technical debt. <a href="http://xprogramming.com/xpmag/jatSustainablePaceInSelfDefense.htm">Sustainable pace</a> is a key aspect of agile approaches to software and to quote Pat Parelli:



<blockquote>"Take the time it takes so it takes less time."</blockquote>



Sometimes that means taking time to think. Sometimes that means taking time for play or exercise. The next time you're given yet another high priority item at work, remember the value there is in slack...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning as Christine and I left our comfy confines for our normal Sunday breakfast at our local <a href="http://www.cariboucoffee.com/">Caribou</a>, I was struck by something.  Our neighbors' upstairs windows were open - not surprising given the gorgeous weather we've had the last couple of weeks but given the nearly 3/4 of an inch of rain that fell in last night's thunderstorms (and I should emphasize the thunder part) I figured they were probably elsewhere on this holiday weekend.  For reasons that will make sense in a bit, their windows got me thinking about change management and its importance in successful projects.

Those of you that know me and have been subjected to one of my rants knows that I'm not a fan of heavyweight methodology or <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/14/formality/">professional methodologists</a>.  The so called process leaders are no different than those hearty souls that maintain corporate frameworks - from time to time, they need to spend some time in the trenches or they lose all appreciation for what the grunts face day to day.  So it's in this almost antagonistic context that I pen this piece on change management.  While I may not be a cheerleader for <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/">RUP</a> anytime soon, I do have a significant appreciation for controlling the inevitable change that occurs on any project.

To illustrate my point, I'll turn to a story unrelated to software in an effort to explain why I think a disciplined change control process is a key aspect of project success.  A few years ago, Christine and I built a new house.  As anyone that has undergone home construction knows, it is a mixed blessing: you (usually) get exactly what you want but for the duration of construction, you tend to eat through stress balls like <a href="http://www.mickjagger.com/">Mick Jagger</a> goes through fashion models.  I won't bore you with all the details (it will be repetitive for anyone that had the misfortune of working within earshot of me a few years ago) but lets just say, we had our share of issues.  Beyond sub contractors that obviously didn't read the painstakingly prepared plans (even I could tell where the washer and its so called "panic pan" was supposed to go) our closing was delayed due to a slight oversight: it turns out that our house was about seventeen feet too close to the road that runs along the West side of our lot.  I still don't know how the city (which approved plans clearly showing the house well over the line), the surveyors, or the builder all managed to miss this minor error but it happened (I know, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/06/abandon-all-hope-of-a-better-past/">abandon all hope of a better past</a>.)  Oh well, after enduring more city council meetings then anyone not actually on the city council should be forced to endure, we moved into our brand spanking new house.

After going through a relatively painful build, I assumed all was well once we moved in - seriously, what else could go wrong?  Well, a few months later, we got a call from the sales rep saying we needed to discuss an issue with the windows next Tuesday.  At this point we couldn't imagine <strong>*what*</strong> could be wrong and the rep didn't have much info but we weren't too concerned - after all, we survived an amendment to the PUD (no, I'm still not sure what that means.)  With this baggage, we showed up at the appointed time and I was quite surprised when the person we were meeting had a last name that bore a striking resemblence to the builder of our development - turns out he was the developer's son so I knew something had to be major for kin folk to be running the meeting.

Mr. "son-of-the-developer" was very polite and explained that our home had a slight problem.  It turns out that the windows in the two upstairs bedrooms (you know, the ones where children go) weren't exactly up to code.  Apparently rooms where people sleep are required to have an opening of x inches so that a fully outfitted fireman would be able to enter and drag you to safety in the event of a fire (good luck to anyone that has to drag my unconscious body from a burning building - I hope there are a few of you.)  Now, I'm not sure <em>what</em> home inspectors are actually looking for these days but I <em>know</em> they signed off at various points throughout construction so I figured (wrongly it turns out) that our home was up to spec.  How silly of me.

Once I got over my surprise that our brand new home wasn't quite up to code, I was curious how exactly this could happen.  Mr. "son-of-the-developer" explained how, due to considerations in the laundry room, they had moved to smaller windows on the lower level of the house.  Like any changes to their plans, this modification went through their normal change management process where it was reviewed by numerous individuals including folks that know the building code.  Unbeknownst to them, at a later date, a draftsman then modified the windows directly above those changed on the lower level to match - for this guy it was all about the symmetry!  Of course the draftsman wasn't up to speed on the building code in this county (or any county for that matter) so he didn't realize that his minor change made a material difference in the home - but it sure made it prettier to his eye!

Of course I'm not sure how their review process allowed such a modification but I was told that draftsman was no longer employed by the company (turns out ours wasn't his first transgression) and they used our experience to further strengthen their process.  So what does this have to do with software?  As my (soon to be former) team knows, change happens but when it's not managed well, it really is painful.  You see our customers tend to be very demanding and as one said the other day "Everything I want is a high priority" (and then went on to say, uncharacteristically, that in retrospect, many of his emergency requests weren't quite as critical as he thought at the time.)

Building software isn't the same as building a house - once your foundation is pored, it's pretty hard to decide you want to tack on an extra thousand square feet.  But just because software is more ephemeral doesn't mean the change is any easier than that made in the physical world.  However, my builder knew exactly what it would cost them to fix our situation (which they did) and had we decided halfway through the process to make a change to our plans, they would have obliged - with the additional fees required to make it so.

Many of the customers I've encountered over the years have no idea how expensive it can be to make what they perceive as minor changes to a system.  Much as I would like to place the blame squarely on their shoulders, I really can't - we are as culpable as they.  <strong>We</strong> need to educate our customers on the cost of change, <strong>we</strong> need to help them make informed decisions.  As much as it pains me to say it: we need a process to manage change.  There, I've said it.  I feel a little dirty, but darnit, we need it!

So, how do you manage change in your projects?  How are changes prioritized?  What happens when they aren't?  Let me know what you think.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, today was a pretty strange day.  After more than four years, most on the same team, I've moved on to a new employer.  Now, this isn't quite the same as <a href="http://www.karmacrash.com/articles/2005/08/24/love-it-or-leave-it-indeed">moving to Brazil</a>, but for me, this was no small decision.  Frankly, I first started thinking about this when I read Steve Jobs' <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">Commencement address at Stanford</a> this past year.  Of course it's really easy to do what you love when you've got Steve's bank account, but still, it's good advice.  I was especially touched by his thoughts on connecting the dots but I also liked this quote:



<blockquote>When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."  It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"  And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</blockquote>



As much as I've enjoyed my time at my now former employer, I have to admit, I've been saying "No" for too many days so when my friend Jen dropped me a line about an opening on her team, I was all too ready to see where it went.  While it is very hard to say goodbye to so many good friends, having been <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/31/farewell-casey-farewell/">preceded by others</a> makes it easier.  Still, it was hard to close this chapter in my life.

Besides being one in a line of people that have left, the "blogsphere" has certainly helped me come to terms with this transition.  Chad Fowler wrote a great piece entitled <a href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/LoveItOrLeaveIt.rdoc,v">Love it or Leave it</a>.   He has a <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/AnotherLoveItOrLeaveIt.rdoc,v">follow on piece</a> that lead me to another great read by Kathy Sierra entitled <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/01/you_20.html">You 2.0</a> (seriously, if you're not tracking <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a>, you should be.)  Now, I'm not moving to Denver (though I hear its beautiful) and I'll still be working in Java (though I would love to work on <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>!) but for me this really is a shift.  You see for years, I've worked on "business apps."  Most of what I've done revolves around building some custom software for a specific business function of a company.  Though I've consulted, I've always been a hired hand (in some cases viewed as little more than an expensive typist.)

But that all changes next week.  Next week I write a new chapter in my life - I see what its like to work at a software shop.  No, its not Google or Microsoft (or even Sun) but it is a real live software company here in the Twin Cities!  I actually know a surprising number of people where I'm going so I think I know what I'm getting into - obviously I'll keep you posted here.  I'm nervous, I'm a little scared, but I'm also really excited to see what this new opportunity brings.  To all of you that have offered me your thoughts in the last couple of months I extend my gratitude - you really helped!

I'm going to throw out one more quote (apologies to my qotd readers.)



<blockquote>Don't cry because it's over.  Smile because it happened.
	Dr. Seuss</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Having a couple of days off has allowed me to spend some time watching the various news channels where, of course, <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=katrina&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=nn&oi=newsr">Katrina</a> is the story.  I don't have words to describe some of the images of destruction from the Gulf Coast - it is just tragic.  I was initially stunned by what I perceived as a lack of preparedness but then what do you do to get ready for a storm of that magnitude?  I will admit, I was critical of the initial response but then <a href="http://www.nickfaldo.com/">Nick Faldo</a> put it in perspective during last weekend's coverage of the <a href="http://www.deutschebankchampionship.com/">Deutsche Bank</a> - the area affected by Katrina is around 90,000 square miles which is <a href="http://www.pubquizhelp.34sp.com/geo/islands.html">roughly the size of Great Britain</a>.  This isn't like a tornado that destroys a few cities, this is country sized.  How the heck do you prepare for that?

Anyway, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/30/we-only-support-ie/">I was pretty surprised</a> that the U.S. Copyright Office was requiring IE 6 but I was flabbergasted to hear that <a href="http://www.fema.gov/">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) was requiring Katrina survivors to use IE 6 to apply for aid online!  Wow, what the heck is going on here?  I can see something like "must use modern browsers" but you <strong>*must*</strong> use IE 6?  Here's the <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/recovery/story/0,10801,104440,00.html?source=NLT_PM&nid=104440">Computerworld article</a> on it as well as <a href="http://http://blogs.zdnet.com/Murphy/index.php?p=414">some responses</a> from <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Murphy/">Paul Murphy</a> and a somewhat <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=1812">related piece</a> by <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/">David Berlind.</a>  Frankly, FEMA is pretty busy these days so I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they were just trying to get something up fast so people could start applying for the aid they desperately need.  Of course with the general lack of power in that area, I suspect most people will use other means to contact FEMA...

It's very encouraging to see the outpouring of support from across the nation and the world - if you haven't given yet, here's <a href="https://give.redcross.org/">a link</a> to the Red Cross.  I pray we learn from this disaster but I'm dismayed by all the political chatter over assigning blame and independent investigations.  I know this is naive but I hope the pols don't turn this into some kind of wedge issue in the next set of elections.

<strong>Update:</strong> here's some more <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/developmenttopics/development/webdev/story/0,10801,104505,00.html?source=NLT_PM&nid=104505">commentary</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You know it's a busy hurricane season (and lets not forget - officially, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season">it runs until</a> November 30th) when they get down to my name in the <a href="http://www.weather.com/newscenter/topstories/20050601hurricanenames.html">list</a>!  That said the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/hurricane.html">predicted an above normal Atlantic hurricane season</a>.  Anyway, I do think it's kind of neat that the 14th named storm shares my moniker.  I didn't realize that list repeated every 6 years (with particularly devestating storms retired - sorry Katrina!)

Here's an <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/sfl-nate,0,7273676.story">article</a> from the <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/">Sun-Sentinel</a> that mentions Nate, Google News' <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=hurricane+nate&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=nn&oi=newsr">take on it</a>, and NOAA's <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at5+shtml/">thoughts</a> on where it might be headed.  Silly I know, but it's not often I run into people with my name let alone a hurricane!  I just hope I, err, hurricane Nate, doesn't cause much damage.  Right now, it looks like it will just graze Bermuda.

I have to admit, I really like sites that provide syndication and I've been plesantly surprised by how many organzitions have started offering this service.  While reading up on "my" hurricane, I couldn't help but notice that <a href="feed://www.nhc.noaa.gov/nhc_at5.xml">NOAA offers feeds</a>.  What a great idea - that has to be very useful for people affected by these storms.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Happy Birthday Christine!  Today my lovely wife officially gets a year older and the way she was talking after last weekend's painting adventure I think she's starting to feel a tad more senior too ;)  Last night we had a fantastic party at casa de Schutta - it was a blast!  The usual suspects were here: <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10042">my coauthor</a> Ryan along with his wife and son.  They were kind enough to pick up Christine's good friend Angie from the airport (she's visiting from 'Bama and is still sleeping in our guest bedroom right now.)  Speaking of good friends, one of the several Christines in our life was also here last night having recently returned to the Twin Cities from exotic <a href="http://ci.sheboygan.wi.us/">Sheboygan WI</a>.  I know what you're thinking but it actually is quite a great little town located not too far from <a href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Kohler-Wisconsin.html">Kohler</a>, home of <a href="http://www.destinationkohler.com/ws/ws.html">Whistling Straits</a> host of the 2004 PGA Championship and is, in my humble opinion, one of the best courses on the planet.  They also have some great restaurants - I highly recommend <a href="http://www.crwmag.com/Wistrails/DisWis/Sheboygan1.html">Trattoria Stefano</a> and <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/searchenginedetails/19276.html">Il Ritrovo</a>.

Of course my favorite in-laws were here early helping us get ready.  Special thanks to Gayle for helping me prepare on Friday!  Our favorite "aunt" Lynn was in attendance (tell JP we're sorry he couldn't make it) along with her daughter Sarah and her husband Mike (Ryan and I enjoyed trouncing you and Mitch on the <a href="http://www.worldbocce.org/">bocce ball</a> pitch!)  My good friend Adam came with his lovely wife Holly and family friends Gaynell and Michael were also here.  OK, I'm pretty sure that was everyone!  My folks were at a wedding otherwise they would have joined us.  Anyway, we had a great time, stayed up <strong>WAY</strong> too late talking with Angie and we ate <strong>WAY</strong> too much food!  It's times like yesterday afternoon/evening that I feel really blessed to have so many great people in our life!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today is a always a bitter-sweet day for me.  For any American, 9/11 is one of those "where were you when you heard days" - I was just coming out of an early meeting with Dan V. and walked by Linnea and Andrea's "pod" where they were talking about it with their manager.  I hadn't heard until right then but stunned disbelief doesn't convey my feelings appropriately.  We ended up watching much of the day unfold on the TVs in our company's fitness center.

Of course 9/11 didn't just touch residents of the United States, 83 other countries also lost husbands and wives, friends, mothers and fathers, daughters and sons that fateful day in 2001.  Today is also my <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/09/11/happy-birthday-christine/">wife's birthday</a> and truthfully it always feels a tad odd to celebrate on a day like this but then, it would have been on someone's birthday so what are you going to do.  For me, those days in 2001 were particularly hard - on the the 9th of September I sat with Christine at the gate (remember when you could actually wait with or pick someone up at the gate!) as she prepared to board a plane to India.  So, when 9/11 happened, my wife was half a world away.

I've been watching some of the documentaries about 9/11 recently and it's really amazing, even four years later, to hear the stories, to see the pictures.  I'm always moved by the heroism that was on display as firefighters and other rescue workers, who surely knew the danger yet rushed in to help.  To the men and women who put their lives on the line everyday to protect and serve, a thousand times, thank you.

I recall a quote about dealing with loss that basically said, the larger the chasm left by the loss, the more room you have to fill with love.  Though a tragedy of unparalleled proportion, 9/11 also displayed the tremendous courage of our firefighters, policemen, first responders, and everyday citizens; the character displayed during 9/11 is enough to restore one's faith in humanity.  To all those that lost loved ones, to those brave men and women that ran towards danger, my heart goes out to you today.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my mind, the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/28/the-state-fair/">State Fair</a> truly marks the end of summer, but yesterday was officially the end.  Well, fall officially started <a href="http://www.factmonster.com/spot/equinox1.html">just a few minutes ago</a> but for those of you that think good old MN is frozen, we nearly hit 90 yesterday.  What a wild ride last-night's storms were - I hope all in the local viewing area came through OK...  In light of <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=Katrina&btnG=Search+News">Katrina</a> (soon to be joined by <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=Rita&btnG=Search+News">Rita</a>) it's really minor but still, enough to cause problems.  My old HS was shut down as was my parents' district and talking to my (new) coworkers, some folks had quite a bit of damage.  We had nearly 2.5 inches of rain here but luckily no damage.  Sigh.  Today was one of those "ideal fall days."  Shorts and a sweatshirt in the morning (and yes, I can actually wear shorts to the office now!) by the afternoon, <a href="http://kare11.com/weather/default.aspx">a cool dry 67 degrees</a> right now!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[All right Joe, I said I'd have a list for you before I left...here you go.  And I'm not even going to give you my associate links!
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127565807/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a> - considering how much "<a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/">ajaxian</a>" techniques are used in ION, this is pretty useful.  Besides, I know the authors, I could probably get a copy signed for you ;)</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201310058/qid=1127565424/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Effective Java</a> by Joshua Bloch - must have, we've based a lot of the approached in ION off this book.  Seriously, anyone writing Java code should have this on their shelf.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596005407/qid=1127565496/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Head First Servlets and JSPs</a> - while technically not a "reference manual" it will help answer questions like what you IM-ed me with the other day.  Plus, read this, and I can pretty much guarantee you'll pass SCWCD.  Keep up with <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy's blog</a> too...its fantastic!</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596003161/qid=1127565608/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Guide</a> - there might actually be more up to date references but we used this and the next book extensively.  If the instructor from the JS class had better ideas, that's fine.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596000480/qid=1127565722/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</a> - again, there might be more recent books but this was also a staple.  I've heard good things about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764557432/qid=1127565777/sr=8-3/ref=pd_bbs_3/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">JavaScript Bible</a> as well.</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201485672/ref=pd_sim_b_2/104-0760137-7376742?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance">Refactoring</a> by <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Fowler</a> - seriously, if it has Martin's name on it, just buy it!</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465067107/qid=1127565978/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Design of Everyday Things</a> - if you want to know <strong>*why*</strong> I did many of the things I did with the UI, here's the place to start.  And, you'll never look at doors the same way again...</li>

	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/020161622X/qid=1127566009/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0760137-7376742?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> - a must read for anyone writing software as far as I'm concerned.  I followed <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/">Andy</a> and <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave's</a> principles throughout the application.</li>

</ul>

While I <strong>*love*</strong> books, I have to admit, a lot of what I'm learning these days comes from blogs.  While I've got a few of my favorites in my blog roll, it's not all inclusive.  When I get back we can touch base on blogs I find interesting!  Hope that gets you started...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, we've been quiet long enough!  After a hectic summer of writing, Ryan and I are proud to say <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127567332/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ntschuttacom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is on its way to the printers.  Special thanks to everyone at <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a> for your help - we could not have done this without your extraordinary effort!  We're not 100 percent sure when it'll start shipping, but expect to see it soon.  If you're not familiar with Ajax, a quick Google search will reveal a number of responses but you should start with Jesse James Garrett's piece <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications</a>.

We really believe in Ajax (heck, we did write a book and I assure you it was not for the money!) and we think it will truly change the way people write web applicaitons.  If you've played with <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> or seen <a href="http://www.netflix.com/BrowseSelection">Netflix's box cover hover</a>, you'll know why we're so jazzed about this.  Anyway, Ryan and I have really tried to write a book that will actually help developers.  While Ajax isn't rocket science, there are a number of things that can jump up and bite you; our book will put a few more arrows in your quiver!  We really focused on the developer's toolbox with this book and we really hope it helps people add Ajax to their applications.

<strong>Update: looks like one of the chapters isn't available online anymore howerver the <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/supplementDownload.html?bID=10042&sID=3022">table of contents</a> is.</strong>
Some sample chapters are available via <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10042">Apress</a>: <del datetime="2005-10-15T17:50:25+00:00">Chapter 3: Communicating with the Server and</del> <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/supplementDownload.html?bID=10042&sID=3009&APRESSESSID=c2169a01947f95a17e1397ecd303927a">Chapter 5: Building the Ultimate Ajax Developer's Toolbox</a>.  Enjoy!

I'll have more to say on this in the future and look for some promotional type stuff in the coming weeks.  I will say that <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JUGPresentation.aspx?TopicID=94">we are presenting</a> at <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JavaUserGroup.aspx">TC JUG</a> in November so if you're in the Twin Cities, come on down!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[[...] It&#8217;s been quite a heady few weeks around here - we got our author copies last week and the book looks fantastic! If you ordered early, your copy should be shipping soon (depending on where you bought it). Anyway, we have our first Amazon review by one of the sherifs at good old JavaRanch (founded by Kathy Sierra) and it&#8217;s 5 stars! Yeah us! Mr. Friedman-Hill really captured what Ryan and I were trying to do with Foundations of Ajax in his last paragraph: As someone who has already learned the basics of Ajax, however, I found the second half of the book even more valuable. The last few chapters talk about tools and techniques for building real-life professional-grade applications. There is excellent, detailed information about documenting, unit testing and debugging for JavaScript, debugging Ajax communications, and using some of the newfangled Ajax frameworks that have begun to appear. These chapters credibly demonstrate that it&#8217;s possible to treat JavaScript as a Serious Programming Language. [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[[...] Hecklers are inevitable. If you ever decide to, say, write a book or you give a talk or two for a local user group, you come to realize that hecklers are inevitable. While you probably won&#8217;t have to put up with drunken idiots, no matter how good you are, no matter how fantastic your book or article is - someone, somewhere will think you are full of it. Sometimes they will provide actual constructive criticism and if you&#8217;re lucky they will at least be informed remarks (as in they&#8217;ve actually read your work) but more often than not you will get empty comments. A darkened room (or the anonymity of the web) provide ample coverage for those that can&#8217;t create on their own. As Dale Carnegie put it: Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain - and most fools do. [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

Thanks for writing!  Based on your description, I'm not completely sure what's going on, but if you've actually traced the code and are indeed getting to this check but it's dropping out (i.e., never evaluating to true), that means the return code from the server is something other than 200.  This tells me you are getting some kind of error from the server.  I'd start by determining what value is coming back from the server and work from there.  Good luck!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sorry for the pronounced silence, Christine and I spent a couple of weeks in Spain so between jet lag, sorting pictures, and a mountain of email, I'm a little behind!  Anyway, I was catching up on some of my blog reading when I stumbled on <a href="http://mcslp.com/?p=131">this piece</a> by <a href="http://mcslp.com/">MC Brown</a>.  Nathan Good was instrumental in getting me started in writing and he's one of the guys I really miss from my old stomping grounds.  Of course MC wrote the tutorials <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/07/27/improved-application-development-part-2-developing-solutions-with-rational-application-developer/">surrounding</a> <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/07/27/improved-application-development-part-2-developing-solutions-with-rational-application-developer/">mine</a> and I've really appreciated his advice.  Anyway, I just thought it was pretty cool that MC reviewed a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/159059441X/qid=1129397898/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">great book</a> by a good friend!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the third anniversary of our wedding coming up next week, I was struck by a phrase I heard while planning our nuptials: October is the New June.  We love the fall hence part of our attraction for the date but it was clear even then that more and more people were getting married as the leaves turned.  Well, last night, we celebrated the marriage of my good friend Christine (aka Elder) to long time beau Derek!  It was just an idyllic day - temps were in the mid 60s with a ton of sunshine - frankly the kind of day we had hoped for back in 2002.  Anyway, it was great to catch up with old friends like <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/27/weddings-are-beautiful/">Linnea, Curtis</a>, Althea, and Tom (Al and Tom are getting married next weekend - see, everyone wants a fall wedding but still, I like to think Christine and helped popularize the date!)  Elder was gorgeous and the <a href="http://www.womansclub.org/">Woman's Club of Minneapolis</a> is a great spot for a reception, great location, very intimate setting.  I'd never been a wedding at the <a href="http://www.mary.org">Basilica</a> but it was fantastic!

<a href="http://derekandchristine.com/">Christine and Derek</a>, all our best, have a blast in Thailand (can't wait to see the pictures!)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My beloved <a href="http://www.cariboucoffee.com/">Caribou Coffee</a> went public a few weeks ago and thanks to <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/10/16/october-is-the-new-june/">Elder</a> I was able to partake of the IPO.  Unfortunately they haven't done a <a href="http://smartmoney.com/eqsnaps/index.cfm?story=snapshot&symbol=GOOG">Google</a> but then I didn't expect them to and, frankly, that isn't why I bought the stock.  I've been a loyal Caribou drinker since Elder introduced me way back in 1998 so I guess I look at this as more of a hedge.  Considering what my household spends at the 'Bou in a given year, the stock practically paid for itself.  If you live here in Minnie than you've probably seen <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=192910&p=irol-irhome">quite a number</a> of 'Bous - if you don't then just wait, they're coming!  Even if I wasn't a <a href="http://smartmoney.com/eqsnaps/index.cfm?story=snapshot&symbol=CBOU">shareholder</a> I would still strongly urge you to check them out.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been quite a heady few weeks around here - we got our author copies last week and the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/09/24/foundations-of-ajax/">book</a> looks fantastic!  If you ordered early, your copy should be shipping soon (depending on where you bought it).  Anyway, we have our first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/1590595823/ref=cm_cr_dp_pt?%5Fencoding=UTF8%26n=5%26s=books">Amazon review</a> by one of the sherifs at good old <a href="http://www.javaranch.com/">JavaRanch</a> (founded by <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a>) and it's 5 stars!  Yeah us!  <a href="http://www.javaranch.com/contact.jsp#ErnestFriedman-Hill">Mr. Friedman-Hill</a> really captured what Ryan and I were trying to do with Foundations of Ajax in his last paragraph:


<blockquote>As someone who has already learned the basics of Ajax, however, I found the second half of the book even more valuable. The last few chapters talk about tools and techniques for building real-life professional-grade applications. There is excellent, detailed information about documenting, unit testing and debugging for JavaScript, debugging Ajax communications, and using some of the newfangled Ajax frameworks that have begun to appear. These chapters credibly demonstrate that it's possible to treat JavaScript as a Serious Programming Language. </blockquote>

Our Sales Rank has been great and we've found ourselves in the top 25 in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/new-for-you/top-sellers/-/books/5/books/0/0/1/ref=pd_ts_pg_1">Computers and Internet</a> category.  If you ever write a book you'll be amazed how often you check your Sales Rank - I now fully understand <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas'</a> example project in the <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby</a> session I attended at <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff Just Stuff</a>...

Of course another thing you do when you write a book is check out the reviews.  So far, they've been pretty positive.  We were mentioned on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/index.html">Joel on Software</a>, one of my favorite sites.  <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/10/02.html">Here's the piece</a>.  I believe the first review officially belongs to <a href="http://adminspotting.net/">adminspotting</a> and you can find that <a href="http://adminspotting.net/reviews/Foundations-of-Ajax.html">here</a>.  We got 8/10 with two points deducted for our Java based focus.  Honestly, the Java thing is something Ryan and I talked about a lot in the early days.  At one point we were seriously considering throwing in Ruby and/or C# but ultimately we decided that the server side language really didn't matter - in fact many of the examples use XML to mock the server.  It also didn't hurt that our expertise is in Java (sorry, neither or us has done PHP so I dispute the claim that everyone knows PHP!)  Still, a nice write-up, thanks!  Here's a quote:

<blockquote>I read this book in hopes of getting a good understanding of [Ajax] and not just what the hype says.  I definitely reached that goal with this book. Ryan and Nathaniel did a very nice job at putting together an unbiased tutorial of what Ajax is and how to use it. I say unbiased because instead of writing something along the lines of "Just use it! It rules!", they gave, both, the positives and negatives to using Ajax</blockquote>

Another positive review comes from <a href="http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php">Fred On Something,</a> you can find the link <a href="http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php?title=review_of_foundations_of_ajax&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1">here</a>.  I particularly like the last paragraph:

<blockquote>This is a definitive book for web developers having to spring into Ajaxâ€™s application development world. It will show you the most effective programming techniques, tips, and tricks to create interactive web pages. It will explain you how to use the best free available tools to create your Ajax developerâ€™s toolbox. It is an interesting reading striped of any fluff with an incalculable number of illustrations and examples.</blockquote>

<a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/">Jeff Nolan</a> was kind enough to link to Fred's post <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2005/10/review_of_found.html">here</a>.  Ryan and I are like you - we develop software for a living and we don't have unlimited free time.  While our book certainly isn't the longest one on the market, we consciously tried to deliver what you needed without a lot of fat.  I don't know about you, but my favorite books tend to be pretty focused (in other words, short) and I'm really interested in the new <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Random/Fridays.html">Pragmatic Fridays</a> concept.
<a href="http://www.greghughes.net/rant/default.aspx">
Greg Hughes</a> has a good piece <a href="http://www.greghughes.net/rant/FirstAjaxBookAvailableInPDFEBookFormat.aspx">here</a>.  I like this quote (especially the usable part):

<blockquote>So, go get this book and start to put that XMLHttpRequest object to work for you. Go build something usable and cool. Probably the one big thing that impressed me about this book was the fact that it pushes a test-driven/test-first approach to development (using JSUnit) and the fact that it has so many detailed, in-depth code samples and discussions. It doesn't just present code samples though. It takes you through the how's and the why's, which is cool.</blockquote>

We have another review on <a href="http://ajaxguru.blogspot.com/">Ajax by Kishore</a> that you can find <a href="http://ajaxguru.blogspot.com/2005/10/book-review-foundations-of-ajax.html">here</a> - it provides a good overview of the book with a chapter by chapter breakdown.  All in all, Ryan and I are quite pleased with what we've read so far (and if somehow we've missed your review or comments, please let me know!)  And for those of you that think we and the authors of the other books on Ajax are "opportunistic" I hope you realize that technical books don't make their authors rich.  Heck, given the number of hours we put in since April we would have been better off working at <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/usa.html">McDonalds</a>.  There are lots of great articles out there (are those authors opportunistic?  They were paid for their efforts) but I assure you our book goes beyond what can be presented in a couple of thousand words.

If you're looking for a reason to buy our book I point to <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/supplementDownload.html?bID=10042&sID=3022">chapters 4-8</a>.  Not only do we give you some great examples to get you jump started on Ajax, we provide some excellent information on a sampling of tools that will make your life much easier (at least they've helped us!)  One other thing I want to point out - all of our examples were written using <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>, Ryan on his Windows box, me on my Mac.  For those of you that haven't tried NetBeans in a while, I highly recommend taking it for a spin.  The <a href="http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/download.php?type=5.0b">5.0 Beta</a> is out - Ryan has been playing with it for quite a while and he gives it a big thumbs up.

Thanks to all of you that have reviewed our book - please keep the comments coming.  As I said, if I missed something please let me know.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[No, I haven't gone crazy with <a href="http://www.google.com/translate_t">Google Translate</a> (missing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language">Catalunyan</a> translations I see) and despite many years of Spanish (I flirted with a major in the language but then for some reason I settled on terse phrases and funny squiggles) I couldn't have come up with this title all on my own.  When we were in Spain, Christine and I visited <a href="http://www.museupicasso.bcn.es/index.htm?x=0&y=0">el Museu Picasso</a> in <a href="http://www.thingstodo-barcelona.com/">Barcelona</a>; I love his work and visiting this particular spot was a highlight of our trip.  I was quite moved by his art, especially <a href="http://www.museupicasso.bcn.es/msites/ficha15.htm">Ciencia i caritat</a> (Science and Charity).  If you find yourself in Barcelona, you really should stop in!

Anyway, aside from being struck by what a feakin genius Picasso was, I couldn't help but notice the number of students - art students - that were all over el museu.  I know, it's a museum and art students tend to frequent such places.  Still, it got me thinking about how we teach computer science.  Unlike artists, we don't seem to spend much time looking at great code (let's assume for the moment that there actually is great code out there).  Of course this isn't easy - most code is proprietary and safely hidden away behind obscure licensing agreements that few read.


Things are clearly getting better what with all that open source software out there and Microsoft keeps <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/10/new_source_licenses_from_micro.html">embracing various degrees of openness</a> but do universities use any of this in their classrooms?  When I got my <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/computerscience/">CS</a> degree, I don't recall looking at any code - other than a fellow students from time to time.  I know the counter argument - code and art are just different.  Sure, people were actively "copying" paintings at Meseu Picasso and <a href="http://museoprado.mcu.es/home.html">Museo Nacional del Prado</a> but no matter how skilled, a copy of Goya's <a href="http://cv.uoc.es/~991_04_005_01_web/fitxer/perc83.html">El coloso</a> isn't a national treasure.  However, a copy of Microsoft Office is, well, perfect.

I realize there are differences, but I couldn't help but wonder - should we teach developers in a different way?  <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/">Andy Hunt</a> and <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> makes a compelling argument in <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/articles/ArtInProgramming.pdf">The Art in Computer Programming</a> that software development is more of an art than it's often given credit for.  What would happen if we spent more time "reading" classic code and working on <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Practices/Kata">kata</a>?  What if we started teaching Comp Sci more like art?

Part of what got me thinking about this is great piece written by <a href="http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.MicahMartin">Micah Martin</a> called <a href="http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.MicahMartin.JackAndJill">Jack and Jill</a>.  Essentially Micah is challenging the traditional notion of a four year degree as it applies to software developers in much the same way that <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a>  does with her post <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/07/does_college_ma.html">Does college matter</a>?  I recommend you read her follow up: <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/07/college_matters.html">College matters...sometimes</a>.

I'm certainly not advocating against a four year degree - after all, I have one!  As much as I enjoyed my four years at <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/">SJU</a>, I have to admit, little of what I learned in the classroom applies to what I do day in and day out (though the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/10/16/early-reviews-of-foundations-of-ajax/">writing flags</a> sure paid off!)  I will say that my <a href="http://www.msse.umn.edu/">MSSE</a> has proven far more practical however, if I had it to do all over again, I'd still take the same route.  OK, maybe I wouldn't start out as a chemistry major (though one of the best programmers I know is one!) but the four year experience is something that people shouldn't discount.

There's more to going to college than getting a job - at its core, a degree teaches you how to learn.  In today's economy, knowledge and skills are outdated in a matter of 18-36 months, maybe less.  <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a> had an interesting comment in a session at <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> saying, essentially, that the half life of a speaker is about three years.  During my undergraduate studies, I spent a lot of time on Unix machines writing C++ in a text editor - in the years since I haven't used Unix or C++ (though I do occasionally program with a text editor).  For those new grads out there - if you think getting your degree is the end of your education, I hate to be the one that rains on your parade but you are just getting started.

Of course there's more to school than just book learnin.  For many of us, it's the first prolonged period where we are out on our own.  Some take this too far and kill thousands upon thousands of brain cells.  Still, there are so many important life lessons to be learned on a college campus and the vibe, the energy of being on and around a typical university is palpable.  But still, I just can't help but wonder - is there a better way?

What do you think?  How should we create great developers?  Oh, and in case you were wondering, no esta firmado ni fechado essentially means, we're not sure when he painted this and if you do visit Meseu Picasso you will see this sign.  A lot.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with a lot of what you said, based on my experience as a [6th-year] college senior and intern.  Another reason that 4-year degree is necessary is to land you a good internship.  I don't think any established for-profit business would look at a young person without a 4-year technical degree, to compensate for the lack of experience.  This part has me scared though:

&gt; For those new grads out there - if you think getting your degree is the end of your education, I hate to be the one that rains on your parade but you are just getting started.

But I think that if you truly are interested in programming/IT, whatever (for example), then the type of learning you do post-graduation will seem relevant and will be more exciting (and thus easier to digest) than the theoretical stuff students are subjected to at Universities.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Andy - thanks for commenting!  College degrees are still the norm in our industry and likely will be for the foreseeable future.  At SJU I worked in our IT department with some people with two year degrees and some of them just couldn't fathom why I would spend so much time and money on a four year degree.  At the end of the day, we could both do *that* job - but when it comes time to change, to learn something new, the four year degree kicks in.

We've come to think that college = job and that's not the point.  You are learning how to learn and that will serve you well.  I hate to admit it, it doesn't stop when you graduate.  The delivery mechanism changes though - instead of spending 4 (or 6!) years learning something, you'll take a week here, a few days there.  You'll also find that YOU become a lot more responsible for your education.  Even in college, a lot of what we take is prescribed for us.  In the coming years, you'll learn from books, magazines, presentations - that kind of stuff.  You'll find a lot of "life" is ad hoc learning.  Enjoy the process, don't fear it!

Don't knock theory too much - yes a lot of what you've been subjected to isn't "useful" but it sneaks in - you don't even realize that foo class is helpful.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[About the only thing I liked about double sessions in high school was the "free" t-shirt and shorts that came with the job.  Even now, when August rolls around, I can't help but think about all the kids returning to the gridiron - and I'm thankful that those days are behind me.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed playing ball but I don't miss doubles.  At all.  But I will say this in their defense - you really start to appreciate the basics that time of year - things like water, food and shade.

It may seem odd to be talking about late August football in November but I have a point, really, I do.  Let's get back to those t-shirts.  Every year, we'd have some team oriented saying printed on a heavyweight <a href="http://www.championcatalog.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce/ProductDisplay?prnbr=CH2001&cgnbr=A031000000">grey Champion shirt</a>, you know something like "There's No I in Team" and "Team Team Team."  Throughout every practice and every meeting, we were constantly reminded that football is a team sport; the team was the only thing that mattered.  Maybe it's this background but I've always believed that the people and the team they created was far more important than any scheme, system, or strategy but all I know is I've seen teams that on paper shouldn't win more than a few games go undefeated and those with tremendous talent lose more than they you'd think possible.

It is with this background that I read <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn Vanderburg's</a> piece called <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/Software/Development/rails-teams.rdoc">The Right Team for Rails</a>.  While this article is specifically about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, I think it applies to *any* language and Glenn even mentions that at the end.  This part really speaks to me:

<blockquote>
An experienced, skilled team will, in all likelihood, find ways to be successful. An inexperienced one can find many ways to fail. Somewhere in the middle are the teams where each project is a gamble: they might fail, or succeed modestly, or even succeed spectacularly, but itâ€™s very hard to predict the outcome. No tool, language, or framework â€” not even Rails, which I think is the best thing going â€” will change that. When you pick up a powerful tool, it doesnâ€™t eliminate your weaknesses; rather, it amplifies whatever characteristics you bring to it, strengths and weaknesses alike.
</blockquote>

While I don't have anything against process or the people that worship at its altar, I often find myself reaching for <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/">Alistair Cockburn's</a> classic piece <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/crystal/articles/cpanfocisd/characterizingpeopleasnonlinear.html">Characterizing People as Non-Linear, First-Order Components in Software Development</a> - which is just a really fancy way of saying people are more important than process.  I just hate it when a coach brags about how he can fit any athlete into "name-your-key-position" because of his superior system (can you say <a href="http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200201/04_williamsb_green/">Denny Green</a>?).  Of course if that were really all there was to it, wouldn't everyone adopt the same system?  How would head coaches justify their exorbitant salaries?

Of course development mangers are not immune to this virus - typically they are searching for some way to justify why they let the experienced people leave (or why they RIFed them) and process is so often the trump card.  Consultants are quick to feed this myth by assuring said managers that they can plug anyone into their spiffy process and low and behold beauty shall result!

Of course it never works that way does it?  If it did, would not a room full of monkeys be able to produce the complete works of Shakespeare?  By now, shouldn't we have figured out what the "best" process is for software development and adopted it industry wide?  Certainly, if there was a fail-safe way to build software, we'd all use it and we wouldn't hear about staggering failures like the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,66445,00.html">FBI's recent fiasco</a>.

If you ask me, team is awfully darn important when it comes to building great software.  The right group of people really can work magic - and have a ton of fun doing it.  If you've ever been a part of a <a href="http://www.improve.org/team1.html">high performing team</a>, you know what I'm talking about.  I've been there a few times and I think about ways of getting back there regularly.  How about you?  What is the "right" team when it comes to building truly <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/06/kicking_ass_is_.html">kick-ass products</a>?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It always happens doesn't it?  You buy some new-fangled gadget and a week later out comes a cheaper, faster, bigger, prettier gadget.  Sigh.  Back in late August I broke down and <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/22/the-halo-effect/">bought an iPod</a> - mostly for our trip to Spain - and now we have <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html">video iPods</a>.  When I first heard rumors about watching a movie or TV show on an iPod, I had to admit I was skeptical.  Well, I guess I should know better than to do doubt - Apple has <a href="http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/cultofmac/index.blog?entry_id=1267111">sold more than a million videos</a> in less than 20 days despite a rather limited content.

I'm very interested to see how this experiment works especially as more shows and movies are added.  While I doubt I'll be buying one soon (maybe I can give "my" iPod to Christine and buy a newer, shinier video iPod...yeah, I doubt it) I have to admit, I would have watched an episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/">Lost</a> in Spain...]]></content:encoded>

Seriously, haven&#8217;t they read The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma? Look what happened with the video iPod - Apple sold over a million videos in a less than a month - imagine what will happen when more shows, movies, and what not are available.

Now, I&#8217;m not sure how much of a profit ABC gets from iTunes but clearly it&#8217;s a new revenue stream.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, Ryan and I are just delighted at the response we've gotten to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127567332/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a>!  We've enjoyed a very strong Amazon Sales Rank and the second printing will be underway shortly so hopefully the expected shipping times will be dropping soon.  To all of you that have put down your hard earned money for out book, a thousand thank-yous and to those of you that are marking time for a book to ship we appreciate your patience.  If you just can't wait, you can always order the <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10042">eBook</a> version from <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a>...

Since I last wrote, we've gotten a few more mentions that I'd like to highlight here.  First off, many thanks to the good folks at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/index.html">NetBeans</a> - they mentioned us in <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/community/news/newsletter/2005-10-27.html">this week's newsletter</a>.  As I've mentioned before in <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/10/16/early-reviews-of-foundations-of-ajax/">Early Reviews of Foundations of Ajax</a>, Ryan and I wrote all of the examples in NetBeans, he on a Windows box, me on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html">PowerBook</a>.  We are also featured on their <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/kb/articles/books.html">books</a> page in the "<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/kb/articles/books.html#use">uses</a>" section.

Speaking of NetBeans, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen">Roumen</a> was kind enough to mention us in his blog: <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen?entry=learning_ajax_with_foundations_of">Learning Ajax With Foundations of Ajax and NetBeans</a>.  Thanks, we really appreciate the mention and are anxiously awaiting greater Ajax support in NetBeans.  I fully expect that some of the features mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/tor">Tor Norbye's</a> piece <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/tor?entry=creator_and_ajax_the_demo">Creator and AJAX: The Demo</a> will find their way into NetBeans soon.

As a new Mac user, I was particularly delighted to come across <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/RuiCarmo">Rui Carmo</a> of <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space">Tao of Mac</a> and the review of <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2005-10-29">Foundations of Ajax</a>.  Yes, we realize many of the examples used Java (though we also used XML to "mock" the server - so we were particularly interested in David Crane's <a href="http://dave.sunwheeltech.com/wordpress/2005/10/17/mocking-the-server-side/">Mocking the Server Side</a> blog.  BTW, congrats on the book!)  Despite the Java emphasis (sorry, it really is our specialty) Rui gives us good marks.  I particularly like this statement:

<blockquote>Like the few other Apress books I've been exposed to, Foundations of Ajax, becomes "sticky" due to its balanced approach - it's something you read instead of just dipping in and picking up quick recipes to scratch whatever itch you may have, and the smooth ramping in complexity as techniques unfold makes for a good learning experience.</blockquote>

Glad to hear Foundations of Ajax is a good read!

We have a newish 5 star <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/1590595823/ref=cm_cr_dp_pt?%5Fencoding=UTF8%26n=5%26s=books">review on Amazon</a> written by Kavita Devi of <a href="http://ajaxgoals.com/">ajaxgoals.com</a>.  Once again, the last half of the book was called out as especially helpful.  I would like to add that despite what the review says, we do have an <a href="http://www.apress.com/ApressCorporate/supplement/1/10042/1590595823-3022.pdf">appendix</a> that mentions frameworks though I should caution that the space is evolving so quickly anything we wrote was pretty much guaranteed to be outdated the second we wrote it.

Last (but certainly not least) we have <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2005/10/5/1284005.html">a mention</a> on <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog">The Farm</a>.  Thanks guys - we look forward to <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2005/10/31/1332916.html">your thoughts</a> on the book!  I suspect we'll have a few more things to mention in upcoming weeks but just a reminder that Ryan and I will be <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JUGPresentation.aspx?TopicID=94">discussing Ajax</a> at the next <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JavaUserGroup.aspx">Twin Cities Java User Group</a> meeting.  We'd love to see you there!]]></content:encoded>

I think it&#8217;s going to be immensely interesting to see what the next 6-12 months brings in the tool space. While we spent a fair amount of time in Foundations of Ajax discussing tools to ease the pain of JavaScript development, seeing the mainstream IDEs starting to have built in support is a huge step forward. In fairness to the guys at Sun, Tor Norbye has a great write-up about his Creator and Ajax demo at JavaOne and with Sun announcing that all its software will be free I can&#8217;t help but wonder what that will mean for the NetBeans world. Tor clarified what free meant on his blog and frankly, I&#8217;m going to have to try it out! And for those of you that are wondering what NetBeans is up to with JavaScript - Roumen pointed me to this link. [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Java and I have been together now for more than 6 years.  After a college fling with C++ and a very brief not-so-torrid affair with COBOL (coming from C++, a few months was enough to make a guy seriously consider the priesthood), I met Java one fine Spring (you know, the season) day back in the late nineties.  Sure, maybe I was on the rebound but compared to working storage areas, Java was one sweet lady!  Once more I had full blown object support and no silly restrictions on where a comment could go...and of course all the excitement of a fresh new passion.

After the heady first couple of projects, Java and I settled into a nice little routine.  We had a very comfortable relationship - I knew her limits and she knew mine.  Sure, like anyone, I was a little annoyed when every year or so brought a whole new raft of changes and I couldn't help but notice she's added a few kilobytes (OK, megabytes) to her formerly svelte frame.  I'm not one to judge and she just smiles saying "it's just more of me to love."  Or was it learn?

Still, lately I feel like we are starting to grow apart.  After all, I've spent most of my career "webifying" legacy COBOL applications and while I certainly prefer semicolons to line numbers after a while I started to wonder if maybe grafting a web page onto a relational database wasn't just a tad too difficult with Java.

Don't get me wrong, I mean, heck, her support for transactions and threading and whatnot is great - but I find myself largely ignoring so much of the "enterprise" stack.  Heck once I even got into an argument with a guy that insisted I wasn't "doing EE" since my projects were favoring straight JDBC over entity beans.  But as I take an objective look at what goes into generating simple HTML representing a basic table with Java, frankly, I had to wonder - <a href="http://news.com.com/Andreessen+PHP+succeeding+where+Java+isnt/2100-1012_3-5903187.html">isn't there an easier way</a>?  It wasn't that long ago all those spurned by C were saying Java was so much simpler...

Lately, I've been wondering if it's time for Java and I to talk a little break, you know, get some space.  I mean, after all,  I've been faithful (mostly) for the last six plus years and we've had a lot of good times but I can't stop thinking about that sexy little number across the street.  And man, when <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby</a> gets all dressed up in nine inch <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>...can you say stops traffic?

I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  After all, I'm coming up on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Year_Itch">seven year itch</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been getting this question quite a bit lately - especially as people find out about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127567332/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a>.  Obviously I'm not the first to talk about this but I've developed a bit of a stock answer so here goes.  Don't agree with something I've said?  Let me know!

First things first, Ajax has really lost its acronym status so if you're tossing around AJAX, you might get some funny looks.  That said, you'll see both versions depending on where you look so don't sweat it.  If anyone asks, AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.  The term itself comes from Jesse James Garrett and his seminal piece <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax: A New approach to Web Applications</a>.  While the software world certainly didn't need yet another term, Garrett needed someway to succinctly describe "Asynchronous JavaScript+CSS+DOM+XMLHttpRequest."

Second, Ajax is not a specific thing - it represents a collection of technologies, better yet, think of it as a technique.  You might argue that JavaScript and CSS and the DOM are nothing new, so what makes Ajax so special?  Notice above that the 'A' in Ajax, stands for Asynchronous.  Why is that interesting?  The standard web interaction is a request/response paradigm.  Remember, the Web started with a bunch of researchers sharing their reports and studies - a shopping cart was not part of the original concept.  Using <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/">Ajaxian</a> techniques, we can create a richer more dynamic user interface by allowing asynchronous communication with the server.  This also means we don't have to refresh the entire page which can significantly improve the user experience.

At this point you might be saying "<a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/blogs/brentashley/archives/000548.html">so what, I've done this for years</a>."  Truth be told, none of the technologies that Ajax represents are new - however, the widespread browser support is.  Many people (including me) have used iframes to call the server in the background or to submit/repaint just part of the page.  I'll admit, it works fine, but truthfully it's a hack.  Today, thanks to modern browsers allow us to take advantage of a Microsoft invention - the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html">XMLHttpRequest</a> object (XHR for short).  XHR provides a simple mechanism that allows us to call the server and tie the response to a callback function.  With improved DOM support, we can take data from the server and modify just part of a page.

This means we don't have to refresh the entire page just to fill in one or two fields.  A minor thing maybe, but it really opens up some new possibilities.  Like what you might ask?  Well, take a look at two of my favorite examples - the browse section of <a href="http://www.netflix.com/BrowseSelection?lnkctr=nmhbs">Netflix</a> and Google Maps.  With Netflix, just hover over any box cover.  A "tool tip" containing a significant amount of information pops up.  Go ahead, view the source, the information in the bubble isn't hiding in the page - it's requested when you mouse over a specific movie.

What makes <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> so special is the scrolling.  Want to see what's off the map?  Just use your mouse to drag the map.  That's it.  No repaint like Mapquest.  John Carroll glosses over this point in his blog on <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/carroll/?p=1499">Google Maps and innovation</a> but I really think the drag makes Google Maps so special.  And it's not rocket science!  The lads at Ajaxian (<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/javaben/">Ben Galbraith</a> and <a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/">Dion Almaer</a>) whipped out a version in less than 2 hours at a conference.  Don't believe me?  Check out their piece <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/07/ajax_is_rocket.html">"Ajax is rocket science". "Ajax isn't simple". Enough already!</a>

In a nutshell, Ajax is a technique that allows us to create richer web applications - applications that are often indistinguishable from their thick client cousins.  It certainly won't end world hunger or even guarantee you'll make it home in time for dinner, but Ajax will certainly influence what we build over the next few years.  We're only just starting to explore Ajax and what it means but I'm convinced it will ultimately make our web applications more responsive and improve usability.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Nate - congratulations to you and Ryan on getting the book out, I know it was a lot of hard work and you've done a great job.

I've preferred using XMLHTTP myself since 2001 or so on projects that could be limited to the browsers that supported it.  I had thought many times that I might XHR-ify my iframes-based JSRS library but left it as is for those who needed that compatibility.  Of course I kick myself now for not publishing any of my XMLHTTP-based remote scripting stuff at the time, but there are so many fabulous resources now that I don't think I'd be able to offer anything new by jumping back in.

Although it's a great improvement over really hackish methods like iframes or img/cookie, XMLHTTP was still an afterthought and I'd like to see a future where the browsers all have designed-in communication methods that give us more control for error handling, timeouts, retries, etc.

I've subscribed to your RSS feed now - looking forward to following along.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks Brent, we appreciate that!  I'm sorry your schedule didn't allow you to continue working with us (we still snuck a few mentions in there for you!)  You bring up a great point about existing iframe based Ajax techniques - should they be updated to use XHR (oh wait, you're not a big fan of that abbreviation - I blame the guys at Ajaxian for it!).  On my current application we actually have a few instances where we've used iframes and frankly I just can't justify making a change at this time.  Maybe someday, but how do change code that works?

Despite it's widespread adoption, XHR is still as you say an afterthought (just look at creating an instance) and someday I too hope we have a built in way to communicate that is browser independent.  I fear that a lot of shops will delay or avoid "ajaxifying" their apps due to these cross browser issues.  Of course, you still need to rely on the scripting approaches like JSRS if you need to support older browsers.

Thanks for subscribing, I really appreciate another reader!  I hope I write some more stuff worth commenting about...]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yep, it's been a crazy year for me too.  My company now has our wireless infrastructure and services in 400 locations across Canada and I'm hard at work scripting  monitoring and configuration management on thousands of devices of various different types, all the while still building post-surgical analysis tools for the Laser eye surgery industry.  Kind of all hit critical mass just before the book stuff started to heat up and something had to bend.

I agree on not fixing something that's not broken.  I've hardly touched the code on the www.blogchat.com chat application I run with Tim Aiello for nearly three years and there are still quite a few regular users.

At the time I commented that I didn't think XHR was a common enough abbreviation to use, I hadn't yet seen it used anywhere despite having been on top of all of the buzz.  It's become a widely accepted short form since then - looks like you were just ahead of me!

I'm starting to see some of the predictable overuse of Ajax - a user and password box with a login button and then an Ajax call that replaces the entire visible page, for instance.  Some people get a new hammer and every problem looks like a nail.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That's great to hear things are going so well for you and your company!  As someone that wears classes (and has thought about surgery) do a really, really good job with those tools ;)  We really appreciated your help - hope everything keeps ticking along for you!

Its awfully hard to justify changing code just to change code.  It'd be one thing if you had to go in and make major changes that would force you to do massive retesting anyway but even then, I prefer to work in smaller steps...

Well, I think the XHR abbreviation was about the only place I've been ahead of you!  Even then, I used it (yeah, those were my chapters - sorry about the spell checking thing!) because I'm a lazy typist.  Just can't stand typing in the whole thing all the time and I would guess we mentioned XHR dozens and dozens of times.

I'm worrying a bit about overuse myself.  As you say, we've got a new hammer here and I think lots of folks are going to start beating on their thumbs.  I'm kicking around some blog ideas revolving around that - more specifically the volume of tiny, granular requests that are going to start pooping up (can you say data transfer object?)  It will be interesting to see how apps that were architected for say, 50 concurrent users will fair when those 50 users are making dozens of calls instead of just one or two.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're following the whole Ajax thing, chances are, you visit <a href="http://ajaxian.com/">Ajaxian</a> on a regular basis - and if you don't, you really should be.  <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/javaben/">Ben</a> and <a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/">Dion</a> (and now <a href="http://www.robsanheim.com/">Rob</a>) are great and they seem to find just about everything interesting that's happening in the Ajax space.  I should also add, they're really fantastic guys too, if you ever have a chance to see them present, take it!

Back in late August, they <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/08/ajaxiancom_laun.html">launched a podcast</a>.  Now, I'll admit, I was <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/22/the-halo-effect/">late to this whole iPod</a> thing but I have to tell you, I find podcasts really interesting.  Heck, they <strong>*almost*</strong> make me wish for a Californian style commute so I could actually keep up with all the great podcasts out there.  I'm currently "reading" an audiobook and I have to tell you, I find myself gravitating to podcasts...

Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks to Ben and Dion for discussing <a href="http://taconite.sourceforge.net/">Taconite</a> (oh and Ben, it's pronounced like tackle, not taco - though one guy did post something to SourceForge saying Tuesday was Taco Night at his house!  No biggie, I suppose only us Minnesooootans would know that one.)  The <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/11/audible_ajax_ep_4.html">whole podcast</a> is worth listening to but if you just want the dirt on Taconite, its just under 6 minutes into the podcast.  They were also kind enough to mention our book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127567332/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a>!

Ryan and I are really flattered that you guys find the approach so appealing!  And yes, we aren't big fans of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/dom/domref/dom_el_ref8.html">innerHTML</a> - sorry, we've just been burned bad.  Yeah, I know, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html">XHR</a> isn't a standard...but it's better than <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp">iframes</a>!  Yes, innerHTML makes tables a lot harder and frankly, that's one of the best uses of Ajax that we've found.  One of these days I'm going to write about something I built at my former employer called maintainable table - but that's a story for another night.

I know it's odd, but we actually tried to stay near the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-LS-20040407/">Load and Save spec</a>.  We actually think someday...maybe...this will actually be implemented.  Personally, I think it would really help with overall adoption of Ajax if we could guarantee it would work, as desired, across browsers.  Ahh, who am I kidding...that won't happen anytime soon.  Still, we liked a lot of the ideas in there so, rather than invent our own, we just borrowed theirs.

A little latter (around minute 12) in the podcast, Ben made a fantastic point about the hack-ability of Ajax while discussing the <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/11/jsquery_ajax_ja.html">jsquery toolkit</a>.  I couldn't agree more - I want to keep an open mind too but I have serious concerns about any application that is opening up their business data like that.  While I'm sure there are some excellent uses, this style feels like a nail gun or a circular saw - in the hands of a professional, these tools can do amazing things.  However when someone with less skill uses them...people lose fingers.

Thanks again guys, we really appreciate the kind words!  By the way, I'm really enjoying <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ajax/?ajaxian">Pragmatic Ajax</a>.  Like Foundations, Prag Ajax is focussed and very readable.  I know some people think a book needs to be 700 pages long to be valuable but in my experience, I rarely finish a book that size.  Truth be told, I think small books that get to the point without a lot of extraneous material are far more useful to the reader.  I don't know about you, but I certainly don't have a ton of free time to read through a book that tries to be all things to all audiences.  This is part of why I am so excited about <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/fridays.html">Pragmatic Fridays</a>!

I tell you, this whole <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/faqs/beta_faq.html">beta book</a> idea is just great!   This is the second book I've purchased this way (yes, I laid out my own money so don't think I'm biased by a free copy) and I expect to do it more often.  Pragmatic Ajax has some great material, heck the chapter on Google Maps is worth the price of admission!  I've come to expect a lot out of books from the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/index.html">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> and I can tell you that this book lives up to that reputation.  Great work guys!]]></content:encoded>

Wow, I'm glad you found this - thanks for taking the time to drop a note!  We really appreciate it and I think it's really neat that you and Ben thought of a very similar approach.  Honestly, that really helps validate what we're trying to do there.  A podcast would be great - in fact I just sent you an email!  Thanks,

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night Ryan and I spoke about Ajax at the <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JavaUserGroup.aspx">Twin Cities Java User Group</a>.  We had a great time - thanks to everyone that braved the cold we hope you'll take a look at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590595823/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&n=283155&s=books&v=glance&tagActionCode=ntschuttacom-20">Foundations of Ajax</a>!  <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Instructors/Default.aspx?InstructorID=6">Jeff Jensen</a> was a great host, we really appreciate the opportunity to present.  I felt bad for the book that no one wanted (and no, I won't tell you which book that was) and for the lucky folks that won our book - enjoy!

Anyway, people asked me to post the slides so here you go.  Enjoy!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There seem to be a set of questions that any software developer worth his salt asks about any new technology: How are <a href="http://www.antipatterns.com/whatisapattern/">patterns</a> involved?  Will it help me get out of this crappy job?  Is there a conference around February in <a href="http://www.tahiti-tourisme.com/">Tahiti</a>?  Sometimes, we even ask questions about scalability.

The other day, I gave a presentation on Ajax at my company.  Now, I only had thirty minutes so it's not like I got into anything deep but we did have some interesting questions.  Being surrounded by some really great software engineers, someone was bound to ask "does Ajax scale?"  Until recently, scalability was not the most important "<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/ilities">ility</a>" in my world - I only had a few users and they only did a few transactions a week.  However, on my current application, scale matters.  We sell enterprise class software that is key to the businesses that purchase our wares.  For us, this is a central question.

So, does Ajax scale?  Like any good computer scientist, I'll rely on my default answer: it depends.  If your architecture is solid, you shouldn't have any issues with scaling - in fact, if your app can scale well horizontally you'll be just fine.  However, a poorly designed system will be brought to its knees.  Of course, if your system isn't designed to scale, it really doesn't matter what you're doing on the client side - you will have problems!  That said, I'm very interested to see what kind of impact Ajax has on load testing - old assumptions about the number of concurrent users might not hold up when we consider the high number of fine grain calls that Ajax engenders.

Ajax is certainly seeing wide spread adoption - heck, one of my hometown papers, the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/">Star Tribune</a>, has snuck in some hover magic lately.  While I think this is a very good thing, I also realize it will lead to an overuse of the technique.  I know, this is inevitable (new hammer - everything looks like a nail) but I plead with you: think before you leap.  At my company, we are actively looking at Ajax as a performance booster.  Being able to essentially "lazily instantiate" parts of our page will make them smaller and changing just a little piece of the DOM will cut down our full page refreshes.  Those are our primary focuses.  We aren't going to be rewriting our app as a <a href="http://getahead.ltd.uk/ajax/single-page-design">single page</a>!

Don't forget, just because the calls are asynchronous doesn't mean they don't have a cost.  If you start making 30-50 calls on every page where before it was just a few, you might have some issues.  I can't help but think about the early days of EJBs (you remember those, right?) when we had a whole bunch of "get" calls that were all going across the network  and we all know what happened as a result of that experience.  Could we be too far away from JavaScript <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html">Data Transfer Objects</a>?

The <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/">Ajaxian</a> boys mentioned granularity in <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/11/audible_ajax_ep_4.html">Audible Ajax 6</a> - it's around the 17th minute or so.  We have to think about the number of calls we are making to our server and try to minimize those.  For an interesting look at this, take a look at <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/11/scaling_connect.html">Scaling Connections for Ajax</a>.  So, in a nut shell, yeah, Ajax scales - but that doesn't mean we should overdo it.  If we're not careful, we will kill our systems - with thousands of tiny little cuts.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.
-Quarry worker's creed
</blockquote>

That quote comes straight out of one of my favorite books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/104-1739569-9217513?v=glance&n=283155&n=507846&s=books&v=glance">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>.  Ever since I stumbled on this book four plus years ago I have been an evangelist for its teachings.  I read the author's blogs (<a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">PragDave</a>, and <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/">Andy's Blog</a>) religiously and I keep hoping the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Rails Studio</a> will make a detour to the Midwest.

Anyway, one of my absolute favorite pearls of wisdom from Pragmatic is "<a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/fixit.html">Don't Live with Broken Windows</a>."  Basically, a car in a seedy part of town will be left untouched until a single window is broken - then it'll be stripped in a matter of hours.  For more on the theory, check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> entry: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Windows">Fixing Broken Windows</a>.

This theory was brought to my attention today in a code review.  Not that the code was bad (though truthfully, I don't know enough about the business yet to be able to do more than "that variable name isn't very descriptive") but it had some dead code in it.  I'll admit, there was a time (a brief while) when I didn't mind having lines and lines of commented out code but not anymore.  With <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2004/11/10/automation.html">version control</a> (you do use version control right?) there just aren't any good reasons to keep unused code around.  All you're doing is making the code harder to read - and most of us prefer <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=84">writing code</a> anyway!  A simple thing, sure, but next time you're editing some source and you run into a chunk of code that the compiler is ignoring do yourself and everyone else in your shop a favor and burry that code for good.  You can always look back at the history in your version control...

<ins datetime="2005-11-22T02:34:39+00:00"><strong>Update:</strong> I knew there was something else that made me think of this topic recently.  <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/developmenttopics/development/story/0,10801,106105,00.html">Check out Anatomy of Ugly: How Good Code Goes Bad</a>.  This is what happens when you read way too many blogs and newsletters (or so my wife says).</ins>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with you about dead code.  If its not being used, you are just cluttering the program and making things more difficult.  However, I have stumbled upon this several times in code that always makes me pause when i want to delete it.  It almost always looks like this:

//Here's something that we should turn on later when xyz happens...
//DoSomethingImportant();

Now I have no idea what this code is referring to any more.  In my mind if this code should be functioning why isn't it uncommented?  However, how do I bring myself to delete something that obviously was meant to serve a purpose?  No one is ever going to go back into source code control to retrieve something that they don't even know exists.  What do you think about this?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think you are talking about the prototypicall TODO comment.  To me, it's one thing to leave yourself some reminders but to comment out code that truly isn't functioning anymore is just setting yourself up for pain.  That said, I have to consider the YAGNI principle (http://xp.c2.com/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html) - when you write a comment like that you might *think* you will need to turn this on, but how often have you actually done it?  You hit it right on the head when you said "Now I have no idea what this code is referring to any more."  Exactly.  You did when you wrote it...but that was two months (OK two days) ago.  Frankly, I think clean code that is easily modified will provide greater benefit than you *might* get from a bread-crumb like that.]]></wp:comment_content>

I'm pleased to announce that I will be <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/details/schutta.html">speaking about Ajax</a> at the upcoming <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/index.html">Code Freeze</a> at the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/index.php">University of Minnesota</a>.  Looking at the local luminaries on the schedule, I'm amazed to find myself in their midsts.

It's a chance to see a great slate of speakers including James Rumbaugh!  The cost is very reasonable at $70 ($50 if you are a student or an MSSE alum) which includes all the talks, breakfast, lunch, snacks, and the program material.  Here's the email that's going around:



<blockquote>The first annual Code Freeze Symposium will be held on Friday January 13, 2006, presented by the University of Minnesota Software Engineering Center. This is a chance to meet your colleagues and share experiences and best practices in our profession. The theme this year will be "Enterprise Architecture and Development." Details and registration are now available at <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/index.html">http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/index.html
</a>
We will have a full day of talks and discussions focused on practical application of Software Engineering to real-life enterprise architecture and development problems. Our keynote speakers will be James Rumbaugh, one of the leading software development methodologists in the world, and Bran Selic, who has contributed extensively to the definition of Model Driven Development (MDD) methods and tools.

Other speakers this year include David Hussman of SGF, Jim Pichler of Digital River, Mike Calvo of Citronella Software, Don Monk of General Mills, Nate Schutta of PTC, and Scott Costello of Unisys. See the symposium program for details.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past weekend I did something I've never done before.  Now, before your dirty little mind wanders astray, I assure you it was nothing salacious - in fact I was with my in-laws the entire time.  You see, I finally witnessed live <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy">stand-up comedy</a>.  Sure, I've been to my share of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improv_comedy">improv</a> at places like <a href="http://tickets.bravenewworkshop.com/">Brave New Workshop</a> but I'd only witnessed stand up via late night TV and cable.

But Saturday, that all changed - we wandered down to the <a href="http://www.acmecomedycompany.com/">acme comedy co.</a> located in the historic <a href="http://www.mplswarehouse.com/index.cgi">Warehouse District</a> in downtown Minneapolis to see <a href="http://www.derekhughes.net/">Derek Hughes</a>.  My father-in-law actually used to hire Derek (he's a local boy now living in LA) to do corporate events back when he worked for the former <a href="http://www.norwest.com/">Norwest Bank</a>.  Anyway, we had a great time - all the comedians were hilarious!  The atmosphere was fantastic (gotta love that <a href="http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us/vgn/portal/internet/hcdetailmaster/0,2300,1273_100496345_115148474,00.html">smoking ban</a>) and they even served my favorite beverage: <a href="http://www.beersince1933.com/1919rootbeer.htm">1919 root beer</a>.  Besides having a blast, I learned a few things, things that apply in a more general way than I would have imagined.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Some material may not be suitable for all audiences.</strong>  The show we were at was clearly intended for mature audiences and while few of us regularly curse during our day jobs or pull a deck of cards from our underpants, you have to be aware of your surroundings.  Now, I'm not just talking about political correctness and promoting a harassment free work environment - we all know there are some topics that you just don't bring up to around certain folks.  While everyone may see that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes, it's rare that the emperor has any interest in being enlightened on the topic.
</li>

	<li><strong>Some material just won't work.</strong>  Some of this is contextual - jokes about North Dakota probably don't work so well in, say, Orlando.  This point goes hand in hand with the previous one however, you have to realize that some approaches just won't fly in your organization.  Take my company.  We work on one of the largest Java applications on the planet - how receptive do you think we are to, say, rewriting the whole app in C#?  Now in the comedy world, maybe that joke bombs tonight but just kills tomorrow - sometimes that same thing happens in the business world.  Maybe that email about how your team should adopt <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile methods</a> would be better received next week, when your manager isn't stressed out about budgets or that big customer bug.  That said, you can't always change your employer but you can usually get a new one.
</li>

	<li><strong>Hecklers are inevitable.</strong>  If you ever decide to, say, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/09/24/foundations-of-ajax/">write a book</a> or you <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/11/17/tc-jug-slides/">give a talk or two</a> for a local user group, you come to realize that hecklers are inevitable.   While you probably won't have to put up with drunken idiots, no matter how good you are, no matter how fantastic your book or article is - someone, somewhere will think you are full of it.  Sometimes they will provide actual constructive criticism and if you're lucky they will at least be informed remarks (as in they've actually read your work) but more often than not you will get empty comments.  A darkened room (or the anonymity of the web) provide ample coverage for those that can't create on their own.  As Dale Carnegie put it:
<blockquote>Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain - and most fools do.
</blockquote>
Don't take it personally - grow from it but don't let it get you down.  Now if even your parents aren't so sure about your ideas... </li>

	<li><strong>It takes a vast amount of pluck to get up on stage.</strong>  Frankly, this is a corollary to the previous entry.  I have a tremendous amount of respect for those that have the guts to display their work to the public - you risk revealing the limits of your abilities and few of us willingly admit to being less than perfect.  It's very easy to sit on the sidelines and point out where the <a href="http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trsorbonnespeech.html">strong have stumbled</a> but to actually put on a pair of cleats and compete - that takes courage.
</li>

	<li><strong>Engage your audience.</strong>  Of course this isn't anything new to those of you that track <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra's</a> work but <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/01/users_shouldnt_.html">in case you still think it's about you</a>, well, it isn't.  Sure, I love to look smart but your audience is selfish - they want to have a good time (or learn something).  Deliver on that and they will tell everyone they know how fantastic you are.  Try to convince them you are the greatest thing since sliced bread and you will fail.  To quote Dale Carnegie again:
<blockquote>You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.</blockquote>
Comedians <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/06/kill_your_prese.html">don't hide behind obtuse PowerPoint slides</a> - if they did, they'd be out of work pretty fast.  Next time you have a presentation keep that in mind.</li>

</ol>

So there you have it - a simple night out turned into a learning experience (there's a lesson in there somewhere I think).  While I certainly expected to laugh, I didn't imagine I'd see so many connections between the comedian's job and my own.  But now that I have, I don't think I'll ever look at a stand-up the same again.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The downside of software as a service</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll admit, when I first read about <a href="http://news.com.com/Google,+Sun+plan+partnership/2100-1012_3-5887923.html">Google and Sun's</a> <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1969">big announcement</a> (a bit late I might add - we were in Madrid at the time) I couldn't help but think: what would the world be like if I could get at my <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2135&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=zdblog">documents and spreadsheets from anywhere</a>?  While in Spain, we used a few different websites to help us get around and we kept in regular contact with the family back here in Minnie via my gmail account.  It was only during our second week, when we didn't have free Internet access in our hotel, that I realized how cutoff we became without that connection.  Of course being out of touch isn't always a bad thing - with the already <a href="http://www.braunconsulting.com/bcg/newsletters/winter2004/winter20044.html">Shrinking American Vacation</a>, I have to wonder, is it a good thing that someday soon I might be able to get at any document?  What demands might an employer make if we really could check those numbers while on a trip?  I know, many people take laptops or at least a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4279486">Crackberry</a> with them but still - what if Word really was accessible anywhere?

Frankly some of this falls into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> <a href="http://m-w.com/dictionary/meme">meme</a> what with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)">mashups</a> and all.  I hate to disagree with <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>'s piece <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/10/21.html">Architecture Astronauts Are Back</a> but I do think there is something to this Web 2.0 thing.  Sure, it'd be nice to have a more concrete definition but <a href="http://tim.oreilly.com/">Tim O'Reilly</a> has his <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">What is Web 2.0</a> and recently <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/index.html">Paul Graham</a> has gotten in on the action with his <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/web20.html">Web 2.0</a> post.

Anyway, something's happening here, I'm certainly not going to hazard guess as to what, but when you see the tremendous success of <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37signals</a> with fantastic tools like <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> and <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce.com</a> with their CRM solution, you've got to wonder what is the future of the massive in-house IT departments many companies employee to keep their systems running?  Sure some (heck maybe most) of that work is being outsourced to the <a href="http://www.accenture.com/">accenture</a>s of the world but just think of what this idea means to small and medium sized businesses.  They now have access to affordable solutions.  My family used to own a hardware store - we certainly couldn't have justified an <a href="http://www.sap.com/index.epx">SAP</a> installation but maybe we could have taken advantage of other options.

With all that in mind, today one of the major issues with this approach became blatantly clear to me.  Around lunch time or so, our network went down.  No email, no voicemail, no access to our servers, no access to the Internet...nothing.  For about an hour or so, we were effectively shutdown.  Some meetings were still going on and a lot of people just went to lunch but still, that cost us some money.  I don't know exactly what the problem was, but it involved our Internet provider so I doubt it was an isolated incident.  Luckily for us, the problem was fixed quickly but what if it had taken longer?  What if all our documents were on a website somewhere?

Don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing against the hosted model - in fact I think it makes a ton of sense for a lot of businesses.  However, in the brief time without a connection I realized how helpless we were without it.  It's quite remarkable to think that just a few years ago, many of us thought a 56k modem was out of this world...now our T1 line goes down and we get the shakes.]]></content:encoded>

As so often is the case these days, today I ran into a few interesting comments along the same line. Last week, Financial Times posted an article by Richard Waters called The future ends at the firewall. Waters explores the growing divide between the applications people use at home versus what they can use at work. Part of this is a bandwidth issue but more importantly, most IT shops lock the desktop down pretty tight these days. As a former corporate IT person, I totally understand the logic behind this - the net is full of nasty little bugs and many an end user just doesn&#8217;t get that they shouldn&#8217;t open up that attachment from their friend.

		<title>Eclipse gets Ajax Support</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I've mentioned before, tool support for Ajax was coming and sure enough, this week Genuitec LLC announced <a href="http://www.myeclipseide.com/">MyEclipse Enterprise Workbench</a> 4.1 that includes support for developing Ajax based applications with JavaScript editing and debugging.  Its $49.95 per developer cost would be a real bargain just for the JavaScript piece but it also adds better UML capabilities and visual design tools for JSPs and JSF.  Check out this Computerworld piece: <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/developmenttopics/development/story/0,10801,106601,00.html?source=NLT_APP2&nid=106601">Eclipse developers to get AJAX access.</a>

Now, I've been a <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> guy since Ryan turned me on to the improvements made in 4.1 but I have to say: very cool stuff!  I think it's going to be immensely interesting to see what the next 6-12 months brings in the tool space.  While we spent a fair amount of time in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127567332/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a> <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/10/31/more-foundations-of-ajax/">discussing tools</a> to ease the pain of JavaScript development, seeing the mainstream IDEs starting to have built in support is a huge step forward.  In fairness to the guys at Sun, Tor Norbye has a great write-up about his <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/tor?entry=creator_and_ajax_the_demo">Creator and Ajax</a> demo at JavaOne and with Sun announcing that <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/07/21/HNstanford_1.html">all its software will be free</a> I can't help but wonder what that will mean for the NetBeans world.  Tor <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/tor?entry=clarifreecation">clarified what free meant</a> on his blog and frankly, I'm going to have to try it out!  And for those of you that are wondering what NetBeans is up to with JavaScript - <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen">Roumen</a> pointed me to this <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/servlets/BrowseList?list=nbdev&by=thread&from=278835">link</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Sensible Answer to DRM</title>
		<link>http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/03/a-sensible-answer-to-drm/</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2005 20:29:35 +0000</pubDate>

		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://ntschutta.com/jat/?p=51</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[David Berlind has a great piece on a reasonable answer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a>: <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2210&tag=nl.e539">Watermarks: A better DRM than DRM itself?</a>.  Now anyone that knows me can attest to the fact that I get pretty irate that the established media companies have decided it makes more sense to <a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/riaa-v-thepeople.php">treat their customers like criminals</a> than to try to find a way to profit from selling their wares via the Internet.  Let us not forget that when the VCR was first introduced, these same titans of industry claimed it would be the end of their very livelihoods - it's hard to forget Jack Valenti's quote:

<blockquote>I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone.
</blockquote>

It certainly doesn't take a degree in rhetoric to catch his meaning.  Of course this quote was from testimony to a Congressional panel...in 1982.  We visited California a while back and we stopped at <a href="http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/hollywood/website/index.html?__source=LandingSEO">Universal Studios</a>.  I could have been mistaken but it sure looked like they were doing fine and we've had VCRs for quite some time now.  I find it so ironic that had the movie industry achieved their goal of killing the VCR, they literally would have walked away from billions and billions of profits and we might only remember the <a href="http://www.mary-kateandashley.com/">Olsen twins</a> as those cute little kids from that TV show.

That said, I understand the need to protect those that create - artists and authors should be fairly compensated for their work but this protection should not come at the cost of <a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/fair_use_and_drm.html">fair use</a>.  Recently, I've been buying some PDF books and I noticed that <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a> use a watermark of sorts - at the very bottom of the page, it says "Prepared exclusively for Nate Schutta."

Now, as an author, I certainly wouldn't start passing around another author's work without permission but I would have to expect people will think twice before running 20 copies of chapter 4 knowing their name would be on each and every one.  Considering the other, more invasive approaches I've seen I think this is a great approach - it certainly beats a <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/02/the-sad-state-of-drm-today/">freakin</a>' <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html">rootkit</a>!

I realize that I'm just a software guy, but I just don't get how the leaders of these media companies can't understand how much harm they cause themselves when they insist on clinging to a dying channel instead of embracing the new.  Seriously, haven't they read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0060521996%2Fref%3Dpd_sim_b_3%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8%2526v%3Dglance%2526n%3D283155">The Innovator's Dilemma</a>?  Look what happened with the video iPod - Apple <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/10/31/1-million-videosand-counting/">sold over a million videos in a less than a month</a> - imagine what will happen when more shows, movies, and what not are available.  How many would they have sold if you could have downloaded <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0006IO77I%2Fqid%3D1133641026%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_2%3Fn%3D507846%2526s%3Ddvd%2526v%3Dglance">24</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00005JLFT%2Fqid%3D1133641071%2Fsr%3D1-2%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fs%3Ddvd%2526v%3Dglance%2526n%3D130">ER</a>?

Now, I'm not sure how much of a profit ABC gets from iTunes but clearly it's a new revenue stream.  I honestly think if the RIAA and MPAA would spend just a fraction of their lawyer fees on finding a way to profit from the Internet instead of trying to find a way to stop it, they would be looking at massive new income streams.

But that's just what I think.  If you're convinced the <a href="http://www.riaa.com/default.asp">RIAA</a> and <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/home.htm">MPAA</a> are doing the right thing, I strongly urge you to take a look at <a href="http://legacy.randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/">this presentation</a> from <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a> and by all means, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1594200068%2Fqid%3D1133639329%2Fsr%3D2-2%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_2%3Fs%3Dbooks%2526v%3Dglance%2526n%3D283155">Free Culture</a>.

You hit it right on the head - I so desperately want SNL to be funny - I mean I remember (fondly) when it was and frankly, it's the writing.  They've had some good talent (note recent movie careers) but in the last five (heck maybe even ten) years it really hasn't been worth watching.  And don't get me started on the lack of new shows - heck, it seemed like they only produce about 4 shows a year.  Heck, when Sideways was getting Oscar buzz, they replayed the episode with Paul Giamatti just before Oscar time.  Of course the live broadcast was about a month earlier.  Sigh.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On the off chance that you want to see what Ryan and I look like, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen">Roumen</a> <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen?entry=new_t_shirts_of_authors">posted a couple of pictures</a> of us.  We're modeling the stylish shirts the kind folks at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> sent us (thanks again!)  This pictures were taken by my lovely wife (who is also extremely patient - she did sit around and listen to us talk for a couple of hours) just after <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/11/17/tc-jug-slides/">our talk</a> at <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JavaUserGroup.aspx">TC JUG</a>.  As we've mentioned before, we wrote all the examples in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590595823/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&#038;n=283155&#038;s=books&#038;v=glance&#038;tagActionCode=ntschuttacom-20">Foundations of Ajax</a> using NetBeans.  Seriously - if you haven't tried NetBeans in a while, you really should, I'm a convert, enough so that I added a banner to my site.  And no, I don't earn fees from anything you see on the sidebar - they are all organizations I feel strongly about supporting.

Speaking of talks - just a quite reminder that I'll be <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/11/23/code-freeze/">talking</a> at <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/index.html">Code Freeze 2006</a> in January - if you're in the Twin Cities area I hope to see you there.  Also, Ryan and I will be speaking at <a href="http://www.otug.org/">OTUG</a> in April.  There is also a pretty good chance I'll be talking at <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/">St. John's</a> in the spring sometime.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, I wrote a piece on <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/11/30/the-downside-of-software-as-a-service/">The downside of software as service</a>.  As so often is the case these days, today I ran into a few interesting comments along the same line.  Last week, <a href="http://www.ft.com/">Financial Times</a> posted an article by Richard Waters called <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/628673d0-6294-11da-8dad-0000779e2340.html">The future ends at the firewall</a>.  Waters explores the growing divide between the applications people use at home versus what they can use at work.  Part of this is a bandwidth issue but more importantly, most IT shops lock the desktop down pretty tight these days.  As a former corporate IT person, I totally understand the logic behind this - the net is full of nasty little bugs and many an end user just doesn't get that they shouldn't open up that attachment from their friend.

But it doesn't just stop with the ability to install software.  Many companies have their firewalls zipped up blocking all sorts of sites.  Some of this makes sense - I mean, if you're surfing girlsgonewild at work, you are asking to get fired.  Still, the filters I've encountered are crude at best (I once had an email from Sun blocked...near as I can tell, the filter didn't like the acronym for Java User Group...) and why other sites were blocked just didn't make sense to me.  At my previous employer, all web based email was blocked - boy, I didn't realize what a pain that was until I moved.  While I don't check my mail constantly, it's sure handy to bop in there from time to time.

All that said, I get why most corporate shops are locked down and I'm not sure I blame them.  Still, I have to wonder what happens when our customers get used to working with some of these apps at home and start to demand them at the office.  Are we really doing them a service?  What happens when they get frustrated and find a way around us?  It seems to me that we are much better off trying to get ahead of this trend and managing it as opposed to trying to kill it (ask the RIAA how their approach is working with illegal music downloads...it's pretty hard to buck the market).  We need to facilitate innovation!  I use <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> and <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/">Backpack</a> a lot and I think they would help many an organization yet I suspect some firewalls block them.  Is it any wonder more and more corporations are outsourcing IT?  How many companies look at their IT shop as a slow moving impediment that spends more time saying no than helping drive results?  Why not find the lowest bidder - the service couldn't be any worse.  We may not like QD (quick and dirty) but sometimes that is exactly what is called for.

There is yet another angle on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service">SaaS</a> that caught my attention - do we trust the organizations that have our information?  It's one thing to have a few links on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> but what happens when Google has access not only to all your email but all your searches, documents and spreadsheets?  Personally, I have a lot of faith in Google but what happens when their stock price drops and angry shareholders start demanding they take advantage of the vast wealth of personal information they have?  What company wouldn't pay handsomely for access to data on all the searches done on Google?  Of course a lot of people think <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=is+google+evil%3F&btnG=Google+Search">Google is evil</a>!

<a href="http://www.sourcelabs.com/blogs/ajb/">Alex Bosworth</a> has a post along these lines: <a href="http://www.sourcelabs.com/blogs/ajb/2005/11/trust_morality_and_software_se.html">Trust, Morality, and Software Services</a>.  While it's one thing for a company to sell our personal information, what happens when governments get involved?  Apparently Yahoo turned over a reporters personal data:

<blockquote>The Chinese government, one of the most corrupt and repressive regimes in the world, decided that this reporter was a traitor and asked Yahoo to hand over the reporter's identity. In an unbelievable breach of ethics, Yahoo responded to China's request by handing over personal details about the reporter without any resistance.
</blockquote>

Recently <a href="http://www.wral.com/news/5287261/detail.html">Google searches were used against a murder suspect</a> - now prosecutors say they got the information from the man's computer but the just as easily could have asked Google directly.  <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/index.php?p=41&tag=nl.e539">We may trust Google</a> but what happens when a subpoena arrives?  Anything in your search history that you might not want to share?  I can't wait for this to be used in a race for some political office "my opponent is of weak moral character - he routinely searched for..."

I think most of us don't mind sharing data - as long as we know exactly <strong>what</strong> we sharing and <strong>with whom</strong>.  I don't mind that <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> knows what books I've purchased and I'm pretty intrigued by what they recommend to me based on this data.  However, I wouldn't be pleased if I found out they were routinely selling that information to third parties.  I've had an <a href="http://home.ingdirect.com/index.html">ING account</a> for quite a while now (how can you beat an FDIC insured account yielding 3.75%?) and I was really amazed when I got their <a href="http://home.ingdirect.com/faqs/faqs.asp?s=PrivacyPolicy">privacy statement</a> - they've adopted opt-in.  As far as I am concerned opt-in should be the default...not the other way around.  Maybe a lot of people don't care as much as I do but anytime I run into a site that says "we will not sell you information...<strong>ever</strong>...unless you let us" well, I get a lot more loyal to that site then one that says "we <em>value</em> you're privacy, which is why you can opt out if you call 1-800-we-sellu between noon and 1 on the third Tuesday of the month and ask for form 7452."

Privacy will be one of the major issues of the next 10-20 years and I think people are coming around to the value of their personal information (how many of you have <a href="http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/paper/bb/papershredders.htm">shredders</a> now?)  Still, I think it will take a few Senators having their identity stolen to see substantial change.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm about the least paranoid person you will ever meet when it comes to online shopping and what not (probably because I actually feel like I know what I'm doing).  But even I have begun to worry a little about how much personal information is sitting out there.  I bet I've purchased items from 50 online retailers through the years.  Could I tell you what they all are, or if they are even still in business??  No way!  Did they sell their servers to some surplus computer store without wiping hard drives??  Maybe.  Have you seen this new thing credit card companies are doing?  You run this little web app and it generates a single use credit card #.  Who cares if someone steals the number?  They can't use it.  Innovation, you gotta love it!]]></wp:comment_content>

MIT (I think) did a study a year or so back where they bought several hundred recycled hard drives and discovered several thousand credit card numbers.  I would *hope* that a major Internet retailer is smarter than that...but....who knows.  I think there is a lot to like about one time use numbers especially for a sight that you might not trust.  I feel pretty secure with Amazon and Nike but others...give me pause.  Heck, I've got one credit card that I use solely for web purchases - if it gets stolen, fine, I cancel it and I move on.  Good comment Joe!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Virtually everything I read these days comes from the web - beyond just a few parts of the Sunday paper, I get all my news from online sources.  I also read a ton of blogs and whatnot and while I don't mind reading short pieces on a screen at a certain point I just want a physical copy.

Most news sites get this and accordingly have a print button somewhere on the screen.  Lately I've been using aggregators like <a href="http://news.google.com/nwshp?hl=en&tab=wn&q=">Google News</a> so the articles I'm reading are coming from a variety of sources and inevitably I end up searching for a print button!  With all the design guidelines out there and the general commonalities on the web, why is there so much variety when it comes to print options?  Sometimes it's a link, other times a button.  I've seen the link/button at the bottom of a story, the top, the left, the right...I mean come on, can't we all just agree on an approach here?  I know that the actual formating of the page for printing can be tricky but can't we at least come to a consensus for <strong>*where*</strong> to find the darn thing?

I can understand (somewhat) that different sites act differently, but what about good old <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a>?  If you go to a normal news story - say this one about <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/12/07/katrina.fund/index.html">Katrina relief</a>, you'll find PRINT THIS at the bottom of the story.  However, if you venture over to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/">CNNMoney</a> - say this article about <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/12/07/pf/taxes/house_amt/index.htm">AMT relief</a>, you see PRINT at the top of the story.  Sigh.  They don't look the same, heck they aren't even named the same...  Honestly, do news sites actually think people only use one source?

Here are just a few different print options:
<ol>
<ul>
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a>:
<ol>
<ul><img src="/images/cnn.png" alt="CNN's print button" /></ul>
</ol>
</ul>

<ul>
<a href="http://money.cnn.com/index.html">CNNMoney</a>:
<ol>
<ul><img src="/images/cnn_mon.png" alt="CNN Money's print button" /></ul>
</ol>
</ul>

<ul>
<a href="http://www.startribune.com/">StarTribune</a>:
<ol>
<ul><img src="/images/star_trib.png" alt="StarTribune's print button" /></ul>
</ol>
</ul>

<ul>
<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/">SFGate</a>:
<ol>
<ul><img src="/images/sfgate.png" alt="SFGate's print button" /></ul>
</ol>
</ul>

<ul>
<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/">MSNBC</a>:
<ol>
<ul><img src="/images/msnbc.png" alt="MSNBC's print button" /></ul>
</ol>
</ul>

</ol>


Maybe I missed it, but have <a href="http://www.uie.com/">any</a> of the <a href="http://www.useit.com/">usability</a> <a href="http://www.asktog.com/">guys</a> provided some thoughts on this?  Is it just me, am I just getting cranky?  And don't get me started on pages that don't even have a Print button...oh wait, my site doesn't!]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good questions.

There's two issues here. One is the ease of which you (or anyone else coming to the site) can find the print function <i>when you want it</i>. The other is whether it's named consistently or placed consistently on the page.

The latter won't guarantee the problem is solved. The former will. 

It's possible that the first issue could be helped by using consistent imagery/naming and a consistent location placement. However, after studying this problem for a long time, I've come to the belief that those things don't help as much as we think.

The real question is: if we brought a hundred users to each of these sites, how many would have trouble finding the print feature? If none of them ever have trouble, should we do something about the inconsistency?

What I want to know is why do we have to have a button on the site to make something printable? Isn't that fixing a symptom? Wouldn't it just be better to have the browser's print button and menu option produce a page that looks great on paper?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Jared,

Thanks for the comment - I've been a big fan of your work for some time now, honored that you read this!  Your last point is so poignant - why do we need the darn print buttons anyway?  The browser already has that function!  To use a crude analogy, my DVD player already has a play button - I don't expect every DVD I buy to have it's own play mechanism.  Along the same lines, if you user can't figure out how to play a DVD, the answer isn't a longer manual...

Frankly, when I come upon a new site, it does take me a while to find the print option;  It's not more than a few seconds (usually), but it just drives me nuts that I have to search for it in the first place.  Truthfully, on a given site, users will find the print button.  However, I don't use just one site - I consume dozens and dozens.  I'm not so concerned about whether the link/button says Print or Print Page but I would like to see some consistency in location.  Is it the biggest issue in HCI today?  Absolutely not - but it's just annoying enough for me to write about!  Thanks again for the comment!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By now, I suspect you may have noticed this piece: <a href="http://www.usabilityviews.com/ajaxsucks.html">Why Ajax Sucks (Most of the Time)</a> which, at first glance, looks an awful lot like an <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/">Alertbox</a> from noted usability expert Jakob Nielsen's <a href="http://www.useit.com/">useit.com</a> site.  I for one am a fan of Alertbox and have read a couple of his <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/books.html">books</a> (and of course I think the other N in NN/g is one of the best minds around - check out his site: <a href="http://www.jnd.org/">jnd.org</a> and go read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465067107/qid=1131892570/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-1739569-9217513?n=507846&s=books&v=glance">Design of Everyday Things</a>.  Seriously, go ahead, I'll wait.) so I was really interested to see what Nielsen would have to say about Ajax.  Of course, it didn't take long to realize this was just a some folks having a little fun!  BTW - Nielsen has posted a note on his site disavowing any connection...

The first notice I got of this was from my old <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~jschnepf/">college advisor</a> - he wanted my input!  I'm not sure if he knew it was a hoax (and was just testing me) or if he wanted my honest feedback.  <a href="http://ajaxian.com/">Ajaxian</a> got into the mix too: <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/2005/12/jakob_nielsen_w.html">Alertbox Spoof: "Why Ajax Sucks (Most of the Time)</a>".  This clever piece arose from <a href="http://usability.typepad.com/confusability/">Confusability</a> - and they're having quite a bit of fun with it!  Check out <a href="http://usability.typepad.com/confusability/2005/12/why_ajax_sucks_.html">their link to the spoof</a>, and their follow up <a href="http://usability.typepad.com/confusability/2005/12/hurricane_ajax_.html">Hurricane Ajax - The Aftermath</a>.

While we can all have a good laugh about this little spoof, it does raise an important issue: what are the usability impacts of Ajax?  Frankly, I think Ajax is one of the first technologies I've encountered where I can truly say - it significantly improves the user experience (if used properly).  On my application we think Ajax can make a real difference - enhancements our customers will notice.  But it has to be done with care.  Like any good tool, Ajax can both help and hurt depending on how it's applied.  Done right, you'll exceed users' expectations.  Do it poorly and all you'll do is increase their frustration.  How do you know what you're doing?  It's really simple - just test it with real users.  If you screwed up you'll find out pretty fast.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, I don't think people should feel too bad about being caught up in the spoof - it really was spot on and made some excellent points.  I do think Ajax is pretty great (hey, I did write a book about it!) but it isn't the right solution for everything.  Undoubtedly, we will see some really poor uses but that is natural with any new technology/technique.  Heck, we've been writing web apps for nearly 10 years, thick apps for over 30, mainframe apps forever...and we still find ways to screw those up.  Like most anything, the truth is in the middle.  Ajax won't cure all the world's ills and it isn't evil...it can make significant improvements to the user experience when done properly.  Hopefully the "Slashdotting" will bring more attention to Ajax abuse without quelling Ajax development!]]></wp:comment_content>

The KnowNow RSS reader, publishing tool, and admin tools all use the AJAXREST format in UI implementation as does Gmail. AJAX is used to create a more Web 2.0 (interactive Web) experience using &#8220;Asynchronous JavaScript and XML&#8221; enabling browser updates with out refreshes. I am sure we can all see the value inherent in that paradigm. The funny thing is that KnowNow has had the capability before Gmail (and AJAX for that matter) ever existed&#8230; [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

I've been meaning to mention <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen">Roumen</a>'s <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen?entry=i_ve_recorded_a_netbeans">NetBeans song</a> for some time now.  First of all, the lyrics are fantastic but you really need to <a href="http://roumen.name/blog/netbeans_song/netbeans_song.mp3">listen</a> to him sing it!  If you don't think <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> is worth checking out yet, the song should convince you ;)

When I first stumbled on the NetBeans Song, I certainly didn't realize that this was a trend!  Today I was catching up on some of my podcasts when I gave Michael Mahemoff's <a href="http://softwareas.com/index.php?name=ajax-basics-podcast-1&page=">Basics of Ajax</a> podcast a listen.  <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/">Ajax Patterns</a> is a great resource (I'm very interested in the <a href="http://softwareas.com/index.php?name=ajax-design-patterns-book&page=">book</a>!) and I also enjoy <a href="http://softwareas.com/">Software As She's Developed</a>.  What really stood out in this particular podcast though was the very end where he included <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/">OK-Cancel</a>'s first-rate <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/archives/feature/2004/02/worlds-first-hci-rap-we-got-it.html">HCI Rap "We Got It."</a>  Now, you really have to be a geek to fully appreciate it but trust me, you have to give this a <a href="http://s90180263.onlinehome.us/www.OK-Cancel.com%20-%20We%20Got%20It.mp3">listen</a>!  I'm a closet HCI guy and I was really jamming along, but, apparently I still can't dance...  Are there other examples of geek music out there?]]></content:encoded>

Then there was a recording of Stallman singing the free software song, and various remixes - http://www.gnu.org/music/free-software-song.html

Lastly the recording at http://rathergood.com, although mybe not geeky, may appeal to geeks (they appeal to me, especially "we Like the Moon" http://www.rathergood.com/moon_song/)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I grew up on a farm.  Well, not a real "working farm," we didn't make our living off the land, but we had a decent sized plot and at one point we ran quite a few head of cattle.  No, we didn't milk them (what are you crazy - those things need milking twice a day...every day) they were beef cows (which is to say we had a freezer full of hamburger and steak).  Along with the bovines (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_longhorn">Texas Longhorns</a> mostly - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:TexasLonghorn.jpeg">this one</a> reminds me of one of our old cows, Harriet - and yes, the girl cows have horns too...) we had horses, cats, dogs and a goat.  Oh yeah, and we had goldfish too.

Now, unless you've been around the 1,000 gallon tanks that are used to hydrate large animals, you might be really surprised to hear that we had goldfish on the farm.  Like us, large animals often like to drink with their meals.  Unlike us, they lack opposable thumbs and mirrors so they don't always realize when they've ahh, still got some feed in their snouts.  Without fail, bits of corn and hay are deposited in the water tanks which, if you've ever been to a dorm room inhabited by college age males, you know what happens next.  Algae and other nasty stuff develops and that just doesn't make for good drinking!

Unlike your dog's little dish, you can't just dump out a 1,000 gallon tank everyday - you have to live with a little crud (OK not so much us as the beasts but it isn't fun to look at).  So what's a rancher to do?  Well, you toss a few goldfish in the tank and let them have at it!  Goldfish are great because they're cheap - and you go through a few on the farm.  Some just flat out die (it's not like the water is <a href="http://staff.jccc.net/pdecell/chemistry/phscale.html">pH</a> balanced) others have a pretty good idea what Jonah went through.  Needless to say, you just don't get too attached to goldfish...

So one day, my mother brings home a dozen goldfish - apparently they were on sale somewhere - and we proceed to dump them into our various tanks.  As expected, about half died almost instantly perhaps from the shock of moving from the fish equivalent of a studio apartment to a 50,000 square foot mansion.  Or maybe they were just afraid of cows.  But the other half survived.  Strike that, they <strong>thrived</strong>.  Not only did they make it through the winter (the tanks were heated to prevent freezing), they had babies.  And they changed color - they weren't gold, they were a brownish camouflage, in fact you could barely see them.  They also grew...<em>a lot</em>.  While they probably wouldn't have tempted a <a href="http://bfl.flwoutdoors.com/">pro bass angler</a>, these weren't your little sister's fish.  Needless to say, we were quite impressed with our little fish farm!

Lets see, I had a point...really.  Oh yeah, meetings are like goldfish - they grow to the size of their container.  I've attended <strong>A LOT</strong> of meetings lately (my teammates were planning to steal my computer...there was a pool to see how long it would take me to notice) and I've discovered that if you schedule a meeting for 1 hour - it will take 1 hour...or longer.  Ever so rarely, you'll get done with what you set out to accomplish in less time than you budgeted and people will actually break but more often than not they just stick around.  I think it's a similar mentality to many a golfer these days - I paid my green fee and I'm going to take my time darn-it.  Or maybe so many people live in meetings all day that they can't imagine being anywhere else.  Of course these sickos have bladders of steel.

I've also discovered that meetings will quickly fill the open slots on your calendar.  Like I said, the last couple of weeks I've been getting my mail delivered to conference rooms.  Without fail, I'll check my schedule in the morning, content that I'll have a couple of hours to answer email only to find by the end of my first or second meeting the cracks in my day are filled.  It's kind of like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097351/">Field of Dreams</a> - if there is an opening, chances are someone will take it.

I'm not (completely) railing against meetings - sometimes they really are necessary.  But the next time you schedule a meeting, ask yourself: do we really need to meet on this or will email suffice?  When you do schedule a meeting, make sure you only invite those people that absolutely need to be there.  I know, maybe you work at one of those places where your boss (or user) insists that he (or she) be in any meeting where any decision is made but don't take that to mean you need to invite half your team.  And if you think you'll only need 30 minutes then only schedule the meeting for 30 minutes!  Give people an hour and they'll use it, force them to economize.  Of course you may want to book the room for an hour...  One last thing - if you schedule a meeting for Friday afternoon, bring treats.  You owe us.]]></content:encoded>

I remember back when I actually looked forward to meetings because they helped me fill up my day.  Oh to be a lowly peon again!  I'm also convinced that meetings with more than 10 people where everyone is expected to contribute are worthless.  These are sometimes called brainstorming sessions, but they turn into 10 separate conversations.  Boo big meetings.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Few meetings require more than half a dozen participants...  I think people suffer from a couple of afflictions.  One is just plain CYA - invite everyone so that no one can complain later they weren't invited.  Of course bad PowerPoint works the same way, if I put it in the presentation I have your tacit approval - sounds like something I've heard from the current administration (well, we did tell a few members of Congress so it's perfectly OK to spy on citizens).

Two, it spreads the blame.  If I am in charge of something but I'm too chicken to make a tough call, I just get 10-15 people in a room so if it turns out I'm wrong, I can say "well, WE made this decision so if I'm an idiot so are all of you..."  Of course this is just a special case of CYA!

Three, people want to keep everyone informed but sometimes that best accomplished with a 1-1 or just email out the notes to a wider audience.  Yes, I remember when I used to like meetings...now I mostly loathe them.  I've had a few weeks where I'm pushing 30 hours....and I still have "real" work to get done!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The two most dangerous words in software engineering are what if - as in "what if the customer wants to..." and "what if some obscure thing happens when..."  I'm not talking about all uses of what if - it's critical if you're <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">Thomas Edison</a> and you're dreaming up the next great breakthrough, but if you're building software, what if will bury you.  A what if does not imply a requirement - and spending too much time on theoretical needs prevents you from meeting real ones. 

The next time you are <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/15/meetings-are-like-goldfish/">in a meeting</a> and someone says "what if..." stifle the scream welling up within you and politely remind your team of the <a href="http://xp.c2.com/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YAGNI principle</a>.  Ask for the specific requirement.  Inevitably, when you're reviewing your design, someone will point out that you need to account for their favorite obscure situation.  This revelation will spur someone else to mention another arcane circumstance.  Some developers will consider your design a failure if it can't easily handle these exceptional cases.  Don't succumb.  Build a class that makes the common case simple and easy - <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/miami-ink/miami-ink.html">tattoo</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 rule</a> to your forearm (or their forehead).  Remember - making the atypical possible does not equate to making it effortless.

I've seen too many projects that get caught up in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">cup holders and the chrome</a> forgetting that they don't have steering or brakes.  Plan to <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/">refactor</a> - you will anyway.  It may be boring, but <a href="http://www.gojohnnies.com/football/">doing ordinary things extraordinarily</a> well can lead to pretty phenomenal results.  <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a> hits it on the head - <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/simple_means_launching_something.php">Simple means launching something</a> (yes <a href="http://www.windley.com/">Phil</a>, <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2005/12/cut_the_vision.shtml">I can relate!</a>).  To quote:


<blockquote>Moral: If you find yourself talking more than walking, shut up, cut the vision in half, and launch it. You can always fill in the gaps later. In fact, youâ€™ll know more about what gaps need to be filled after youâ€™ve launched â€œhalf a featureâ€ than if you tried to fill them in before launching anything.
</blockquote>


I couldn't have said it better myself.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Winter must just affect people in a certain way - for some reason, I can't seem to open up my blog reader without running into two or three articles on API design.  Now, I'll admit, I've seen some pretty poor APIs in my day (I still cringe when I think of the classes I've dealt with that had a <code>singleton</code> method) but it's quite interesting that there has been so much chatter on this topic of late.  I'm sure some of it is cross contamination - chances are the people I'm reading are also reading each other (in a nutshell, that's what the collaborative filtering concept is all about - the notion that similar people like similar things).  Or maybe short (cold) days just force people to sit in front of their computers more (my notebook is quite warm).

Anyway, I just thought it would be of value to my reader to point out some of the recent news on API design.  Near as I can tell, <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> kicked this all off with a piece titled <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/HumaneInterface.html">Humane Interface</a> in early December.  Ironically, I was helping a coworker with a validation service just after I read this and it did influence my advice.  I'm somewhat torn on Fowler's assertions here - on the one hand a small interface can be easier to learn however, a more explicit (though larger) interface can actually be easier to use.  Like so many things, your users will let you know though I think it's key to remember there is a big difference between <em>writing a framework</em> like API that will be used by lots and lots of developers (that are outside of your purview) and good design for APIs that are <em>used within an application</em>.  And this distinction explains some of my disagreements with <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=dichotomy">Eamonn McManus</a>' <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=142428">Java API Design Guidelines</a> piece.

In general, I like Eamonn's article.  He hits it right on the head when he says design to evolve and his quotes of Bloch's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=ntschuttacom-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201310058?v=glance%26n=283155%26s=books%26v=glance">Effective Java</a> are spot on.  I was also pleased to see that he touched on ease of use and easy to learn - too many APIs are clearly not designed for regular old developers.  Sure, they might make sense to <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> PhD candidates but to those of use without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League">Ivy League</a> (and yes, I know that Stanford isn't an Ivy League school...) educations, they are a bit obtuse (see we can use big words too  - though I will admit I really like <a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/macosxhints/2005/11/dictroar/index.php">OS X's built in dictionary</a> - to the point where I get irritated that my work machine is XP).   Still, I couldn't help but think that Eamonn approaches this topic from the standpoint of framework designer (in this case someone that works on the Java specs).  For instance, I'm not so sure I agree completely with his assertion concerning backward compatibility.  Sure, you can't just remove a public method in a superclass (twice...in a week) without checking with the rest of the team but if we never remove anything, why even have the concept of <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Deprecated.html">deprecation</a>?

Good old Mr. Fowler wasn't quite done on the topic of APIs.  First, you should check out all the responses that Martin's <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/HumaneInterface.html">Humane Interface</a> entry caused (scroll down).  Of course the opposite school of thought is <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/MinimalInterface.html">Minimal Interface</a>!  Honestly, I think I'm leaning towards larger interfaces but maybe it's just because the days are getting longer.  Ask me again next fall.  More recently, Martin added another entry: <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html">Fluent Interface</a>.  I'm really intrigued by this approach though it seems like a Fluent Interface really only makes sense in context - in other words, the methods by themselves aren't so obvious.  I'm not sure where this falls on the ease of use/easy to learn scale but I do wonder if newbies would have a hard time getting up to speed on a application that made wide use of Fluent Interfaces.  Of course maybe they only make sense in concentrated doses.

But he's not done yet!  Oh no, he's practically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energizer_Bunny">Energizer Bunny</a> of API articles.  Just last week, Martin posted an entry on <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DuckInterface.html">Duck Interfaces</a>.  In general, I find dynamic languages can be easier to work with especially when I think of all the casting I've done in Java over the years.  Seriously <strong>I</strong> put the objects in the collection, <strong>I</strong> know what type they are...again it's the difference between writing a framework vs. writing an application.  If I'm writing a framework that you are going to use, by rule I have to distrust you and write more defensively.  Of course if I control the code I can be less wary.  I'm also reminded of a comment <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> made concerning dynamically typed languages: when was the last time you got a class cast on a deployed app?  Why didn't you catch it in testing?

I'm sure there are oodles of other articles out there but this small subset caught my attention - enough so that I actually took the time to sit down and write this up.  Of course I could also just be procrastinating on my latest project...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From the "Only in Minnesota" file, the iPod is apparently a must have ice fishing tool.  Now I admit, I've never ice fished - I enjoy catch and release in the summer...when it's warm...but the idea of sitting out in 10 degree weather dropping a line into a hole...  Sorry, I just don't have the patience for it though as evidence by the hundreds of fish houses I see on area lakes lots of folks clearly do.  Of course I've heard of people who have fish houses that are more comfortable than their actual homes - most (if not all) are heated and it's not uncommon to have microwaves, pizza ovens, TVs...even satellite dishes.  I suppose if I was fishing from a couch while watching the game maybe I could be talked into it!

Anyway, I just had to post a link to <a href="http://tuaw.com/">The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a>'s recent post about <a href="http://tuaw.com/2005/12/29/have-ipod-will-ice-fish/">ice fishing podcasts</a>, yes, apparently the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/index.html">DNR</a> has a <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/news/podcasts/index.html">podcast on ice fishing</a>!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I consider myself a client side guy.  I arrived there rather by accident - I was one of the least experienced (in terms of years worked) members of a team that was slated to build the company's first Java based web application.  When it came time to break the overall group into small teams, the three greenest (myself included) staffers were assigned to the client tier.  I guess that sent a subtle message - the stuff the user would actually see wasn't all that important so put the junior team members there.  Ironically enough, the three of us also had the majority of the OO experience on the team (can you say procedural Java?)...but that's a matter for another blog.

Oddly, we did spend a fair amount of effort on the user interface and we spent a remarkable amount of time doing <a href="http://usability.gov/methods/usability_testing.html">usability testing</a>.  We had a fantastic UI architect that worked really hard to come up with a look and feel that was consistent between IE and Netscape (ah, the glory days of the late 90's and serious browser incompatibilities - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/">I love the smell of browser checks in the morning</a>!)  For reasons that still escape me, we actual brought in a rather pricey IBM usability expert to help us test the app and it was at this stage of my career where I discovered the joy of <a href="http://www.usability.gov/pubs/062005news.html">paper based</a> <a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/prototyping_tips/">prototypes</a> (otherwise known as <a href="http://jthom.best.vwh.net/usability/lofiprto.htm">low-fidelity</a> or low-fis).

The nice man from IBM taught a few of us how to moderate testing sessions.  He told us to remind users that <strong>*they*</strong> weren't being tested, that failures were actually <em>our mistakes</em> in the design.  He taught us how to let users struggle, that telling them what to do meant, again, that we'd failed.  We were coached on encouraging users into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol">thinking aloud</a> about their experience and tell us how they expected the app to work.  But the most important thing he taught was that users lie.  OK, he didn't say it quite that way but it's like Mom always said: "actions speak louder than words."  What a user <em>says</em> rarely matches what a user actually <em>does</em>.  It's why asking a user what they do day to day just doesn't work - you need to actually observe them in their natural habitat (it's kind of like being an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology">anthropologist</a> though truthfully it's more like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography">ethnography</a>).

I'm not advocating that we completely ignore customer and I don't mean to imply that they deliberately mislead us (well some do) but yes, <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/09/listening_to_us.html">listening to users is harmful</a>.  According to <a href="http://www.useit.com/">Nielsen</a>, the <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20010805.html">First Rule of Usability? Don't Listen to Users</a>.  Those of us that spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with ephemeral stuff like code are pretty good at working with abstractions (though we don't hold a candle to those theoretical physicist types...) however, the average user has a hard time imagining what might be.  Not to quote <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy</a> twice in one paragraph, but there is some <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/the_quantum_mec.html">quantum mechanics</a> at work here.  Again, actions and words don't always match up - many of us respond to a kind of social calculus and consciously or not, we seek approval by giving people the answers that <strong>we think they want</strong>.

Of course what users want will be impacted by what we give them.  It's one of the main reasons <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html">heavyweight methodologies just don't work</a> - the feedback loop is too long and it gets short circuited by a desire to resist change.  I used to think that my customers were just neurotic - we'd go build what they asked for, show it to them, then they'd say "it's all wrong - change it."  It was considered rude to point out that we'd built exactly what they asked for...

I realize now that this is completely natural, my users were just reacting to what we were building.  This is the fundamental strength of having <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/releaseoften.html">frequent releases</a>, customers get something to work with earlier and they can make adjustments to what they are asking for.  Fundamentally, this is more efficient: if you've only spent a week or two developing a feature and discovered that it's not useful, so what, you've only lost a couple of weeks.  If you wait 18 months to discover that, well, you've just wasted a ton of money.

So, (mostly) don't listen to what your users say.  Watch what they do - get in front of real live users and watch them work.  Asking what they do isn't sufficient, a lot of times you'll either get an incomplete answer (do you remember what you did yesterday morning?) or you'll get the party line answer (well, this is what we are supposed to do).  Don't settle for the manager or the VP, even if they were the best at doing "foo" five years ago, things have probably changed (plus they probably wrote the proverbial book on doing the job and they misguidedly belief this is how things are actually done).  So get out there and do some good old fashioned observation.  If you're lucky you might just build something people will actually use.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Excellent Post!  Sometimes users like other times they are too grounded in their day-to-day work that they don't have any idea what _can_ be done.  I've recently worked on a system that was a web app port of a "green screen" application.  Developers (note - there were no real designers as is very typical) did exactly what the users said they wanted and guess what the got:  A complete copy of their green screen app with prettier fonts.  What a waste...]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Another thing I don't get is why projects don't automatically plan for a second release after the initial goes in?  Not that we should plan for things to be wrong, but it is inevitable that once a system goes live and the users start using it for real they'll want to change some things to make their job easier.  I have seen too many times recently where we dump a system into production and it just sits there without any enhancements after that.  

We have an end-customer app that went to production 2 years that hasn't had a single update applied to it since even though our webmaster receives between 10-15 complaints about it per week.  If you attempt using it over dial-up, you might as well not even try.  Get an error in the middle of a multi-step process?  Too bad, you have to start over.  We've tried to get momentum behind enhancing the app, but the standard reply we get is that there isn't any money in the budget to do it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks guys, I really appreciate the comments (sorry I didn't respond sooner - been a bit busy...)  John, I've encountered EXACTLY what you're talking about - well, we want this.  Why?  'Cause that's what the old system did.  It's just amazing to me that people don't grasp that rewrites allow you to reengineer the business process, a process that is all too often tailored around deficiencies in the systems!  In fact, the last "real" project I was on at my former employer was no more than a direct port to the web - we couldn't even modify the database to be, oh, I don't know, relational!

Jeff, great point about release 2.0.  Too often I've seen projects derailed because users HAD to have all these features *right now!*  Like waiting a couple of months would be the end of the world...  Man, no updates in 2 years, what's the point?  Especially if there have been numerous complaints.  Ahh, you wouldn't want to listen to users on something like that - heck, they should just learn to do it right.

Well, you two have inspired to write another post - hopefully soon!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I meant to post this over the weekend but alas, time was not on my side (I mean, hey, there was <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/peter_king/01/16/mmqb.real/index.html">some great playoff football</a> on!)  Anyway, <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/">Code Freeze</a> was a smashing success - we had somewhere around 220 people attend and most stayed for the entire day.  Thanks to everyone that came!  I had a great time, the <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/">UMSEC</a> folks took really good care of us, and I really enjoyed meeting all of the speakers.  And I've got lots of material for blog...now I just need the time.  Sigh.  There were some excellent talks and I'm expecting next year's event to be bigger and better so if you missed this go round, be on the look out for it in the fall!

My <a href="/slides/Ajax and the Enterprise.pdf">paper</a> was enclosed in the proceedings but my <a href="/slides/Ajax and the Enterprise Slides.pdf">slides</a> weren't so here those are.  I was also asked for a <a href="/slides/code freeze links.rtf">clickable copy of the footnotes</a> so I've added that as well.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I'm making up for a few quiet weeks with a smattering of <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/16/history-of-programming-languages/">quick</a> <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/16/code-freeze-slides/">hit</a> posts (and, maybe one longer one...we'll see).  I ran into a post on <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/">Seth Godin</a>'s blog <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/blink.html">about how quickly people judge your website</a> and I just had to post this.  Seth points to a recent article: <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060109/full/060109-13.html">Web users judge sites in the blink of an eye</a> on <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/index.html">news @ nature.com</a>.  Apparently, we have about 50 milliseconds to impress users.  Yes, that's 50 milliseconds...ouch.

I knew people could make some quick assessments - I mean at our core, we are just fantastic pattern matchers as Ray Kurzweil explains in this <a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/interviews/v7i01_kurzweil.html">recent interview</a> found on <a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/">ACM Ubiquity</a> (I'm going to have to, ahh, borrow <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0670033847%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1137460166%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">The Singularity is Near</a> from my dad...and if you really want to bend your mind a bit, check out <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/index.html?flash=1">his website</a>).  Anyway, if you've read the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0316172324%2Fqid%3D1137460403%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Blink</a> (and I plan to - thanks in no small part to <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/default.aspx">Ted Neward</a>'s <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2005/12/08/THE+Book+To+Read+For+2006.aspx">recommendation</a>.  You may want to read <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/01/book_review_mal.html">Eric Freeman's review</a> on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a> as well) Malcolm Gladwell explores snap judgments.

Or is it Digged?). Nearly 48 hours have passed since I talked about Snap Judgments and two of the blogs I track have commented on the topic (if you visit Seth&#8217;s post you&#8217;ll see I wasn&#8217;t the only one to reflect on it!). First, Christine Perfetti of UIE chimed in with this piece that quotes the same article Seth did. However, she provides a bit more depth - and I have to agree with her assessment concerning the implications of the findings. That said, since reading Don Norman&#8217;s Emotional Design, I do think aesthetics matter quite a bit. [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now, I'm the first to admit that when I first encountered <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">NetBeans</a> in a training class a few years back I wasn't impressed.  In fact, I thought it was one of the worst tools I'd seen especially given the <strong>*extremely*</strong> detailed instructions the teacher had crafted to avoid all the issues that he (and others) had encountered leading the course.  That said, my opinion has changed 180 degrees since Ryan turned me on to 4.1 (he's a daily build kind of guy) and I've been an advocate since working with it while writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;tag=ntschuttacom-20&#038;creative=9325&#038;path=tg/detail/-/1590595823/qid=1127567332/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846">Foundations of Ajax</a>.

Unfortunately, NetBeans suffers from the EJB 1.0 syndrome - negative first impressions are hard to overcome.  I mean seriously, how many of you identified with Bruce Tate's <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/06/15/ejb3.html">Don't Make me Eat the Elephant Again</a>?  While <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/docs.html">EJB 3.0</a> might be fantastic, I wouldn't bet the farm on its rapid adoption in the corporate world.  Anyway, back to my point.  Today I ran into <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/timboudreau/archive/2006/01/i_thought_id_ne.html">I thought I'd never see the day</a> on <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/timboudreau/">Tim Bourdreau</a>'s blog and <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen?entry=sun_s_tools_are_cool">Sun's Tools are Cool?</a> over on <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen">Roumen</a>'s blog both pointing to <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/">James Governor</a>'s recent post: <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/001203.html">Microsoft Visual Studio Live: Set To Follow Sun's Java Studio Enterprise?</a>

OK, so if you've been around me (or Ryan) for the last several months, you've heard us preach the goodness that is NetBeans.  Seriously, give NetBeans a try, you won't regret it...but don't just take my word for it!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why Accessibility Matters</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've always been an advocate for making applications <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility">accessible</a> - it just seems like the right thing to do.  And frankly, it isn't that hard especially when you're just getting started (baking it in after the fact....well, that's tougher).  Of course if you want to sell to the government, you better know about <a href="http://www.section508.gov/">508</a> and it sure doesn't hurt to follow the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">WAI</a> as closely as you can.

As much as accessibility might be the right thing to do, many business customers refuse to pay for it much as curb cuts were few and far between until the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/adahom1.htm">ADA</a>, which, for now, <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-962761.html">doesn't cover the Internet</a>.  So, how do convince your sponsor that accessibility is more just a nice to have?  Show them this piece from <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/">Seth Godin</a>'s blog: <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/knitting_for_th.html">Knitting for the blind</a>.  Simply making their site work for blind users resulted in customers that vowed to buy exclusively from them (and not just those that were blind mind you).   How much would your marketing department pay for that kind of zeal?  Could your company use that kind of customer?

I think my wine monger is the best around and that's why I recommend <a href="http://www.brightwines.com/">Brightwines</a> to everyone that asks (and many that don't).  It's also why 95% of my wine comes from Dave.  Never underestimate the power of <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">passionate users</a>!  Apparently, showing a little compassion can be good for business...]]></content:encoded>

		<title>You Have 11 Minutes</title>
		<link>http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/18/you-have-11-minutes/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You know, I always knew my day was pretty chopped up, but man, I never guessed it was this bad.  I stumbled across "<a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/53977.html">Why modern offices only let you work for 11 minutes</a>" via <a href="http://www.slowleadership.org/2006/01/distractions.html">this entry</a> on <a href="http://www.slowleadership.org/">Slow Leadership</a> and I had to post this.  I've already said that <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/15/meetings-are-like-goldfish/">Meetings are Like Goldfish</a> (seriously, open slots on my calendar just don't last - a good week has me spending "only" 2-3 hours a day in meetings...) and I was happy to see the folks at <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a> chime in with <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/meetings_considered_harmful.php">Meetings considered harmful</a> which touches on an article titled <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/improbable/story/0,11109,1687547,00.html">Bored meetings</a>.  Can't help but notice that the Minnesota reference!

Some meetings are good, but most are just a waste of time (and money).  It's a very bad sign that many of my current and former coworkers come in early, stay late, or work from home in an effort to "<a href="http://www.davidco.com/">get things done</a>."  Don't managers/companies see the issue here?  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/index.html">Paul Graham</a> touches on this in his piece "<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html">What Business Can Learn from Open Source</a>."  To quote:

<blockquote>Companies spend millions to build office buildings for a single purpose: to be a place to work. And yet people working in their own homes, which aren't even designed to be workplaces, end up being more productive.
</blockquote>


What does this say about most companies these days?  Why do we insist on physical presence?  More importantly, why do we insist on so darn many meetings?!?  I'm not advocating a completely virtual world; in fact, at <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/16/code-freeze-slides/">Code Freeze</a>, <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze/details/hussman.html">David Hussman</a> talked about an issue he saw firsthand with a company that had staff located in the Twin Cities and Canada.  While the local staff thought the virtual standup meetings were working well, the Canadian based team was really frustrated.  David found out why first hand when he visited - there was a slight delay in the audio line so the Canadian team was constantly getting "talked over."  Instituting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHF_CB">CB</a> style "over" paradigm cleared that right up.

Anyway, my point is multitasking just doesn't work - at all.  I mean come on, if even <a href="http://www.trump.com/main.htm">The Donald</a> believes in slowing down...  I think there are a lot of people that confuse face time with productivity and that's just not the case in most jobs anymore.  When we were a widget based economy and people worked on the line, yeah, we had to "be there" to do work and more hours meant more widgets.  I don't know about you, but come 3 o'clock, my brain is pretty frazzled.  And to those people like <a href="http://www.ge.com/en/company/companyinfo/executivebios/eb_immelt.htm">Jeffrey Immelt</a> that think working 100 hours a week is something to be proud of...all I have to say is <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/11/28/8361955/">GET A LIFE!</a>

OK, lost sight of my point here a bit...oh yeah, so, what are you going to do with your 11 minutes today?  Think your boss would <strong>*deliberately*</strong> put you in an environment where you could get so little done?  Here's a better question, what would happen if a company actually made it possible for its employees to have, say 60 minutes of productive time a day?]]></content:encoded>

However, I&#8217;ve been in far too many meetings that were a) far too long, b) had no agenda and c) involved FAR too many people. Sometimes meetings need to involve a large cross section of the population of Cleveland&#8230;but not very often. And what&#8217;s the deal with meetings that don&#8217;t result in action items? I mean, c&#8217;mon, if we just spent the last 60 minutes discussing today&#8217;s great problem, there aught to be some action items (just not for me). Sigh. It could be worse, I could be a manager.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Blog time must be like, well, cat years (we don't currently have a dog around the house...) and you've got to love the echo chamber that is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere">blogosphere</a> (have I been <a href="http://digg.com/">Dugg</a> yet? Or is it Digged?). Nearly 48 hours have passed since I talked about <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/16/snap-judgments/">Snap Judgments</a> and two of the blogs I track have commented on the topic (if you visit <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/blink.html">Seth's post</a> you'll see I wasn't the only one to reflect on it!).  First, <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/author/christine/">Christine Perfetti</a> of <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/">UIE</a> chimed in with <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2006/01/18/snap-decisions-on-the-web/">this piece</a> that quotes the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060109/full/060109-13.html">same article</a> Seth did.  However, she provides a bit more depth - and I have to agree with her assessment concerning the implications of the findings.  That said, since reading Don Norman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0465051367%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1137639260%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">Emotional Design</a>, I do think aesthetics matter quite a bit.

The other interesting connection here was from <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a>: <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/your_sites_got_120th_of_a_second_to_make_a_first_impression.php">about how little time you have to make a first impression</a> which commented on <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyid=2006-01-17T203950Z_01_N17291661_RTRUKOC_0_US-SCIENCE-CANADA-WEBSITES.xml&rpc=22">a different article</a> that discusses the study.  So, just in case you didn't notice, people will judge your site (or application) pretty quickly.  As I mentioned in <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/17/sun-tools-out-ahead/">my post on Sun's Tools</a> - first impressions matter and are hard to overcome.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I suppose it was just a matter of time.  First prosecutors <a href="http://www.wral.com/news/5287261/detail.html">used a man's search records </a>against him in a murder trial, now the government has requested that the major search engines turn over a random sampling of 1 million searches in an attempt to revive an <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">Internet pornography law</a> that was struck down by the Supreme Court as being too broad.  <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-218.ZS.html">The decision</a> against the law points out that filters would be more effective and that websites could simply move their operations overseas to avoid the prosecution.

Not surprisingly, this story is getting A LOT of press right now (as of now, over 1000 hits on <a href="http://news.google.com/nwshp?tab=wn&ned=us&ncl=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-2002328,00.html&hl=en&scoring=d">Google News</a>) and it was a significant part of <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2134555/?nav=navoa">Friday's edition</a> of "Today's Papers" on <a href="http://www.slate.com/">Slate</a>.  The story has been covered by pretty much everyone including: the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/technology/13657303.htm">San Jose Mercury News</a>, the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google20jan20,0,6995079.story?coll=la-home-headlines">LA Times</a>, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/AR2006011903331_pf.html">Washington Post</a> and on <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6028701.html?tag=nl.e589">ZDNet</a>.

Personally, I find this particularly disturbing in the light of the recent <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/17/bush.nsa/">domestic wiretap scandal</a> (which appears to produce great leads: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/17/politics/17spy.html?pagewanted=print">on soccer moms and pizza joints</a>).  I suspect this is a bit of a trial balloon - most won't defend porn and once you've turned over search records for one reason, it makes it that much easier to ask for, say all searches on "bomb making" or "donate to al-Qaeda".  I mean, heck, apparently in a <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/e0904272-8942-11da-94a6-0000779e2340.html">time of war</a>, the executive branch can do anything it wants, right?  I'll probably find myself on a watch list shortly after I post this!

But at least Google is fighting back unlike the other search engines - I can't believe they all rolled so easily (OK, so a couple claim they only gave the Justice Department some of what they want) but when you consider that they <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B54C61B89-2A96-4DAD-A844-A9B994AE79C7%7D&siteid=google">all bow down to China's requests</a> for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/weekinreview/15zeller.html">dissidents' identities</a> we shouldn't be too surprised.  Hey, the the lure of a huge consumer market is worth "bending" principles a bit, right?  Oh wait, it's all about share holder value.  Never mind.  I hope that Google is successful especially in light of this quote from the LA Times article which is particularly frightening if you believe in civil liberties (my emphasis):



<blockquote>Under a section of the Patriot Act expanding the use of so-called national security letters, companies such as Google can be asked to turn over potentially useful data â€” <strong>even about people who aren't suspected of wrongdoing</strong> â€” while being barred from disclosing those requests.</blockquote>



Wow.  Have you ever searched for something that you might not want the government sifting through?  How long until they start fishing through the huge email stores on Gmail and Yahoo Mail?  Of course maybe they <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051220-5808.html">already are</a>...]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Mr. Schutta,

I am a cs student a CSULA.  I am working on a possible extension for the Firefox web browser, as a senior project.  I am currently reading "Foundations of Ajax" and am thoroughly enjoying it.  

The extension that I'm building will allow the user to view a page, right click on a link and unfold the link in the current page, viewed.  I intended to have an xul overlay from which to display the requested page, scroll and stretch, untill a fit was found then save the two pages as one.  

I have only recently discovered AJAX and it's ability to manipuate a web page's request object.  However,  as noted in your book, page 35, Firefox initially disables the ability to request a url that is not in the current domain.  You mentioned a javascript fix for this and I looked across the internet and have so far been unsuccessful.  If possible, could you direct me to the answer of my question.

Thank you,

David Zepeda]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[David,

Glad to hear you enjoying the book!  Cross domain JS is a real pain - in fact there have been a number of posts recently that you might want to look at:

<a href="http://getahead.ltd.uk/ajax/cross-domain-xhr" rel="nofollow">Cross-Domain Ajax. Security Implications in Depth</a>, <a href="http://tech.rufy.com/articles/2006/02/09/debunking-strong-misconceptions-about-cross-domain-ajax-security-issues" rel="nofollow">Debunking Strong Misconceptions About Cross-Domain Ajax Security Issues</a>, <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/On-Demand_Javascript" rel="nofollow">On-Demand Javascript</a> and <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=538" rel="nofollow">What else is buried down in the depthâ€™s of Googleâ€™s amazing JavaScript?</a>.

Honestly, I'm on the fence with this one - some experts believe it's a big deal, others do not.  The magic we allude to in the book is "signing" the JavaScript code but as I understand it, this isn't portable across browsers.  Of course that may not matter to you!  Good luck on your project and I want to point out that we included an email address in the book - feel free to drop us a line...  BTW, you can call me Nate ;)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I ran into a piece on <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki's blog</a> about <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/how_to_get_a_st.html">giving great speeches</a> which dovetails nicely with <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy</a>'s tips on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/10/how_to_speak_at.html">speaking at tech conferences</a>.  Of course I find this type of thing particularly interesting these days as I try my best to find my way into more speaking gigs (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9ZmVyaXMgYnVsbGVyfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=3;ft=21;fm=1">anyone?  anyone?  Bueller, Bueller....</a>)  Like Guy, I used to be deathly afraid of speaking to groups and I don't know when it happened, but at some point a bit flipped and now you can't keep me away from an opportunity to speak.  Heck, at my last job, the joke was I couldn't think without a dry erase marker in my hand (hey, I really like white boards, OK?) and more recently, while discussing developer training one person said, in effect, that they wouldn't be able to keep me away from the podium...  Hey, it's like a drug, give me a whiteboard and a willing audience (optional - I don't mind if they are coerced into being there) and I'm a happy camper!

In Guy's <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/addendum_to_how.html">followup</a>, he mentions the importance of using a conversation tone (again this is reminiscent of an <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/09/conversational_.html">entry</a> on Creating Passionate Users!)  Too often we forget this tip - I've been to a lot of training where it was clear the presenter was following a script and trying to be "professional."  Sigh.  It's a lot more engaging when the speaker cares!  How often have you been to a talk by a "big name" who clearly is bored by the whole thing?  Would you rather listen to that or someone that had an infectious passion for the topic but whose name you wouldn't recognize?  Unfortunately, (it seems) many conferences are "closed" to people that aren't proven names, but the only way to get a name is to speak...]]></content:encoded>

I'm certainly not against meetings - they have their place.  However, I've been in far too many meetings that were a) far too long, b) had no agenda and c) involved FAR too many people.  Sometimes meetings need to involve a large cross section of the population of Cleveland...but not very often.  And what's the deal with meetings that don't result in action items?  I mean, c'mon, if we just spent the last 60 minutes discussing today's great problem, there aught to be some action items (just not for me).  Sigh.  It could be worse, I could be a manager.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Square Peg Round Hole</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many moons ago, I was on a pseudo high school all start football team that travelled to Ireland to compete against a similar group of students from the east coast.  Our coach was a legend in Minnesota high school football (who shall remain nameless...) and he had a decidedly old school, caustic approach to coaching.  Now I was a rarity - I was a "finesse" offensive lineman, I preferred to pass block.  Heck, it was just plain easier, all I had to do was get in your way for a few seconds.  Of course, the coaching legend we were playing for favored the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishbone_formation">wishbone</a>...which, if you know anything about football is basically the antithesis of a passing offense.  I was very much a square peg being pummeled into a round hole.

Around our second or third day on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland">Emerald Isle</a>, we installed a pass play into our offense.  I was overjoyed until I realized that my job was to hook the defensive end because the quarterback was rolling out to my side.  Of course on the same day we added this new play, the defense added a new stunt.  The defensive end (already in an outside shade) was taking an outside rush.  In other words, it was the perfect call for our new play.  Basically, I was being asked to try and take a guy that was trying to rush outside and get him turned inside - not the easiest of plays by high school rules (it's not like I could clip the guy...)

Most coaches would just say, well, they called the right defense, shoot.  Not the legend - he just kept calling the play (of course the defense kept running their stunt and stopping it) and he kept chewing me out all practice.  He didn't mind that the block was nearly impossible.  He didn't care that I was put in a position to fail - repeatedly.  He was going to make a point.  Of course I'm not sure just what that point was...and it would have been smarter to find a way to make it easier for me to succeed.  I could have just pushed the end out towards the sideline but "that wasn't the play" so I was in a bind.  Needless to say, my opinion of this particular coach is not terribly good.

So why do I bring this up today?  Good old <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a>!  I'm pretty sure Kathy is one of the sagest people around - and she really hits the nail on the head when she talks about <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/02/mediocrity_by_a.html">square pegs and round holes</a> (don't miss her take on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/01/giving_a_damn_a.html">performance reviews</a> either).  If you've ever thought you went above and beyond only to get a big old "meets plan" at review time...well, at least you've never been kicked in the head by a donkey (have you?).  At my last job, I had a pretty good manager and he took care of me, but despite my best efforts, I suffered from the "we can't have too many exceeds plans" deal.  My former CEO was big into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy">meritocracy</a> theory which is great if you do something that can be easily measured and the company is actually serious about rewarding <strong>*everyone*</strong> that deserve it (instead of some preconceived bell curve notion of how many raises and bonuses can be given out).  So I know exactly what she means...except I've never been kicked in the head.

So what would happen if we actually tried to put people into positions to succeed?  What kind of company would it take to put square pegs into square holes?  We often hear sports commentators discuss the importance of the role player - that guy that comes of the bench and catches that third down pass or gives you those tough minutes at the end of the half.  They may not be flashy but how many championships did <a href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/michael_jordan/">Michael Jordan</a> win before his supporting cast arrived?  <a href="http://www.nba.com/coachfile/phil_jackson/">Phil Jackson</a> didn't try to get <a href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/dennis_rodman/">Dennis Rodman</a> to be an outside shooting threat (think Phil said - "Dennis, you're great, pink hair and all, but you really need to spend some time on your shooting touch"?).  No, he recognized what his players strengths were and he exploited them to win 6 championships.

The message?  Embrace your strengths!  Sure, we can all improve, but we each have things that we are destined to excel at - this isn't a character flaw.  Would you rather have a team of eight that are all pretty average at pretty much everything or could you take a group with distinct talents and meld them into a winning organization?  My advice - the next time you encounter a square peg and you have the urge to get out your hammer, think about finding a way to <em>square off the hole</em> before you force someone towards mediocrity.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2006/02/05/the-radical-culture-of-offense/">This piece</a> over on the <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/">BuzzMachine</a> sure has gotten a lot of responses.  Hey, I don't like it when people in foreign countries burn the American flag but I'm not throwing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail">Molotov cocktails</a> at their embassies either.  Seriously, take a deep breath already, it's a comic - I don't know about you, but I'm more interested in reading them now (reminds me of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ">protests</a> over <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095497/">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've got my ticket to <a href="http://www.railsconf.org/">RailsConf 2006</a>, how about you?  I'm really excited about <a href="http://railsconf.com/pages/guidebook">The Rails Guidebook</a> (I very much wanted to be at the upcoming <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails/index.html">Rails Studio</a>...sigh).  Anyway, I'm trying to get my employer to defray the costs a bit but I just couldn't pass up this opportunity - heck, the <a href="http://www.railsconf.org/pages/keynotes">keynotes</a> alone are worth the price of admission.  Hope to see many of you in Chicago this June (I <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/02/06/railsconf-65-of-the-seats-sold">wouldn't dawdle</a> if I were you)!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wow.  RailsConf 2006 is <a href="http://railsconf.org/articles/2006/02/08/railsconf-is-sold-out">sold out</a> - in <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2006/02/08/railsconf-sold-out">less than a week</a>.  Glad <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/06/railsconf-2006/">I didn't wait</a> around...  I'm <strong>*very*</strong> excited to be heading down to this event even though it takes place in prime golfing season!  Guess I might have to check out <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a> too.  When I first read <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html">Rolling with Ruby on Rails</a> I never imagined a year later a conference dedicated to the topic would have sold out in such a short time.  Must have struck a nerve huh?  I was quite pleased to see Jay Zimmerman of <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/index.jsp">No Fluff</a> fame is involved along with <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a>.  I can't say enough good things about NFJS, it really is a great experience.  Check the Tour Stops - chances are it'll be coming your way and if you're in the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=47">Twin Cities</a>, I hope to see you there!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A while back, I wrote about two of the most dangerous words in the programing world - <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/21/what-if/">what if</a>.  Like many before me, I've been on teams that were stuck in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">analysis paralysis</a> before and I can't tell you <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/26/make-meetings-useful/">how many meetings</a> I've attended that quickly devolved when people started tossing out loaded phrases like "well, I could see a customer doing..." or "you know, I think it'd be nice if..."  Hey, I've been guilty of <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/rdenum.htm">gold plating</a> from time to time, but I've grown - I fully accept <a href="http://xp.c2.com/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YAGNI</a> in my life.  Now, along with a blood sacrifice, I demand living breathing proof that we need to implement a feature...who am I kidding, I don't have that kind of clout.

The next time you're sitting around trying to figure out what you feature you <strong>*must*</strong> have in your next release, just ask: <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/essential_vs_nonessential.php">is it essential or not</a>?  Of course that doesn't mean you should <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/11/02.html">ship utter garbage</a> either...and don't get me started on all the <a href="http://www.cybergrain.com/archives/2004/11/google_betas_ar.html">beta-ware</a> out there!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Celebrate Early and Often</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've always believed in the motto "that calls for treats" (can you say new person treats?)  Now I admit, some of this is pure selfishness - I just can't resist <a href="http://www.panerabread.com/default.aspx">Panera</a>'s Cinnamon Crunch Bagel but I am also doing my part to keep up team morale (who can be grumpy while eating a doughnut?)  Anyway, I bring this up for a reason.  I've had an odd career when it comes to, ahh, shipping.  Truth be told, I've only had a couple of my applications make it to production (and one happened after I had left the team - and no, it wasn't me...) so I've only gotten to partake in one true "release party."  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the free pizza, but somehow, it left me hollow; seems to me, we need to celebrate more often!

I've spoken about <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/11/rhythm/">rhythm</a> before and I can't stress its importance to the sanity of a software team.  If you've been on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_(software_development)">death march</a> before...you know how <a href="http://www.systemsguild.com/GuildSite/TDM/deathmarch.html">evil they really are</a>.  Let's show off my range - how about a non-software example?  It's only February and I'm sure more than a few people are clinging diligently to that resolution about dropping some weight.  Let's say you want to lose 25 pounds - if you focus on the 25 what happens after you've lost 5?  Are you motivated to keep going or are you downtrodden that you still have 20 more to go?  To be successful, you've got to chunk the goal up and celebrate the baby steps!  Software isn't any different.  Finish that cool new <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/11/03/what-is-ajax/">Ajax</a> widget?  Great, bring in some pie!  Finally approved that functional spec?  Heck, the boss should spring for pizza!

I don't know about you, but I've got a pretty short attention span (hey, what's that - over there?) so if I try to think about everything that my team has to do before our next release, I'll just cry.  That said, I can feel pretty good about clearing some of the low hanging fruit.  <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/releaseoften.html">Short iterations</a> are one of the real strengths (though they <a href="http://www.agileadvice.com/archives/2006/01/the_pros_and_co.html">have their drawbacks</a> too...) of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile</a> movement, one that is often lost in the talk of <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/userstories.html">user stories</a> and <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">pair programming</a>.  The next time you accomplish something - celebrate (and don't forget to invite me)!  Not only will your developers thank you, it might just <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/celebration_is_quality_control.php">improve your product's quality</a>.  Of course you could just go to <a href="http://www.waterfall2006.com/">Waterfall 2006</a> instead.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't think <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/author/jared/">Jared Spool</a> had <a href="http://www.netflix.com/Default">Netflix</a> in mind when he wrote about <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2006/02/13/what-are-we-agreeing-to/">end user licenses</a> but his point fits none the less.  Apparently, Netflix <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/02/10/netflix.renters.ap/index.html">throttles down their service if you're a frequent user</a>.  People who rent more than a set number (known only to Netflix) of films a month find that their next DVD is delayed and that popular releases are dolled out to new subscribers.  Of course Netflix advertises an all you can eat buffet but apparently that's only true if you don't come back for seconds.  In other words, if you threaten their profits, you'll find you get a different tier of service...for the same price as someone that isn't taking full advantage of what they are paying for.  But it's all OK - they revised their terms of use about a year ago so buyer beware right?  Take this quote out for a spin:

<blockquote>In determining priority for shipping and inventory allocation, we give priority to those members who receive the fewest DVDs through our service.</blockquote>

Personally, I think this is just a horrible way to treat customers and I'm frankly amazed that they continue to have such high customer satisfaction ratings.  Imagine if your health club did this - come in once a month and we'll make sure your favorite elliptical machine is waiting.  However, if you dare come in more than 3 times a week...well, we have a rusty stationary bike out back you can use.  Don't get my wrong, I understand the motivation for the executives at Netflix (heck, they'll probably roll out a "premium" service for $29.99 a month that actually gets you unlimited rentals and drops you at the head of the line for the latest Hollywood blockbuster) but is this really a good way to treat users?  Should I poke you in the eye with a sharp stick so long as my end user license says I can?]]></content:encoded>

That said, today I watched something that really got my attention. While I realize this isn&#8217;t the freshest of news items, the video from Channel 9 (gotta love Robert Scoble) on Office 12 has been kicking around our offices lately and to tell you the truth - it really is quite something (maybe not quite as exciting as the multi touch interface, but c&#8217;mon, this is a business application). The live preview idea is fantastic; (feels rather Ajaxy if I do say so myself!) I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve done something only to hit Undo&#8230; I also really like the clean UI - it sure looks like it&#8217;s a much better approach. Bravo!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href ="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/pad/"><img src="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/images/pad_small.jpg" alt="Practices of an Agile Developer" /> </a>
I was lucky enough to get a early look at <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/pad/">Practices of an Agile Developer</a> by <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=11">Venkat Subramaniam</a> and <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/">Andy Hunt</a>, one of the newest books from the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/index.html">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a>.  I've actually been anxiously awaiting this book ever since I saw Venkat speak about <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=78">Java generics</a> at the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> conference last year - and I wasn't disappointed!  Whether you're already doing agile development or just looking for a good resource to get started, this book is a must read.

PaD covers what you would expect from a book about agile development including integrate early and often, automate deployment, use short iterations, collective ownership, and keeping it simple.  However, it's the personal practices that set this book apart from others on the subject.  Practices of an Agile Developer discusses many of the "soft" aspects of software such as criticize ideas instead of people, keeping up with change, and the importance of rhythm.

Speaking of rhythm, this book is a joy to read.  Unlike some tomes that drone on and on, PaD presents material in easy to digest chunks of 2-5 pages making it particularly approachable for those of us with limited contiguous reading time!  Venkat and Andy do a great job of putting these practices into context by providing "devil" and "angel" quotes throughout (and if you're anything like me, some of those devils hit awfully close to home...).  Each section leads off with the devil tempting you to do something foolish and ends with an angel's advice on following the practice.

It's one thing to read about something but unless you've actually successfully applied the knowledge (or have Venkat  and Andy on retainer), it can be very difficult to know if you're doing it right.  To help reinforce the material, each section gives you a sense of what the practice should <em>feel</em> like and as someone that has only worked in pseudo agile environments, I found these pointers particularly helpful!

Subtitles are often overlooked - but "Working in the Real World" really is fitting.  Unlike some books that preach practices that only work in narrow niches or the halls of academia, this book gives you practical advice that you can apply to your work <strong>today</strong>.  The book is on its way to the printer and should be available in early March - <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/pad/">preorder</a> your copy now!  But <a href="http://www.matthewbass.com/blog/2006/02/01/practices-of-an-agile-developer/">don't just take my word for it</a>...]]></content:encoded>

In the break after the first session, I ran into Jeff Jensen of TC JUG fame. Speaking of which, Ryan and I will be back at TC JUG in July.

		<title>The Upside of Ajax</title>
		<link>http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/20/the-upside-of-ajax/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Near as I can tell, none of the major Ajax sites have referenced <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a>'s piece entitled <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/14/AJAX-Performance">The Real AJAX Upside</a>.  Tim hits on some of my company's reasons for adding Ajax to our applications - it makes them perform better (or, more precisely, it looks to the customer like it does - waiting for a full page refresh just takes time).  While I fundamentally like the idea of pushing more work down to the client (kind of like <a href="http://www.seti.org/site/pp.asp?c=ktJ2J9MMIsE&b=179086">SETI</a>) we can't forget that the browser is not always the ideal environment for, you know, heavy duty XML processing.  I've been stressing the usability aspects of Ajax but maybe I need to push this comment:

<blockquote>Yeah, that cool, responsive AJAXy stuff is nice but maybe itâ€™s the icing on the cake; the real win is making the Web run faster.
</blockquote>

What do you think?  Should we pitch Ajax as a usability story or is it about performance?  Or is this just a classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win-win_game">win-win</a> situation?  Oh, and if you are trying to justify bringing Ajax into your application, check out <a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/andre/?p=52">Measuring the usability and business benefits of AJAX</a> and <a href="http://justaddwater.dk/2006/01/14/ajax-performance-stats-roi-and-business-value/">AJAX performance stats, ROI, and business value</a>.

		<title>iPods and the Olympics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like many, I've been watching a fair amount of Olympic coverage these days and throughout, I've been amazed at the number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipod">little white earbuds</a> (don't they know the <a href="http://www.digg.com/apple/Free_earbuds_from_Apple">sound sucks</a>?) I've seen.  I don't know why I'm surprised - I mean you can't walk more than about 100 feet without seeing a nano or a 4G somewhere (if I had just bought Apple stock when my <strong>*dad*</strong> purchased himself an iPod for Christmas a couple of years back...)  Gez, if it's this bad in the big Minnie, I can only imagine what San Fran or New York is like!

I've written about <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/08/22/the-halo-effect/">my iPod</a> before and I have to admit...I really like it.  Frankly, I don't listen to that much music but I'm digging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasts">podcasts</a> especially while I'm working out.  I used to try to read a book or a magazine but never again - it's just much easier to listen to something and with the quality of the podcasts out there I can learn a ton.  Anyway, two of my favorite blogs commented on iPods and the Olympics and I just had to chime in.  First, Clive Thompson, over at <a href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/">collision detection</a> posted <a href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2006/02/i_blogged_a_whi.html">Do iPods help Olympic athletes perform better?</a> where he points to an <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/olympics/bal-te.to.ipod17feb17,0,3066620.story">article</a> from the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/">Baltimore Sun</a>.  A little while later I ran into <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a>'s post <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/02/ipods_increase_.html">iPods increase performance?</a> which talks about the same article but also references <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/sports/olympics/12snowboarding.html?ei=5070&en=ae8a9623824b65e5&ex=1140757200&pagewanted=print">this New York Times piece</a> (interestingly, Clive and Kathy posted within 20 minutes of each other).

I completely understand athletes listening before their events - I used to throw the shot and the hammer and part of my routine was a selection of music to "put me in the mood" but the technology I had at my disposal pales in comparison to today.  The jackets that the snowboarders wear sound incredibly cool:

<blockquote>The U.S. snowboarding team's pinstriped uniforms are already wired for the machines, with a nifty iPod-size pocket, speakers in the hood and a control panel on the left sleeve that allows the athletes to select songs.</blockquote>


How cool is that?  Man, wish I had one of those keeping me warm!  The iPod will be indelibly identified with this Olympic games - from the speed skaters preparing for their races to the snowboarders rocking out while performing you couldn't miss them.  And most remarkable at all - Apple didn't pay a dime for that exposure which, to me, makes it all that much more authentic.  

<blockquote>"One of the lasting images of these games is going to be these snowboarders with their iPods," said Abraham Madkour, executive editor of SportsBusiness Journal, a trade magazine that covers the sports industry. "It's the perfect form of subconscious marketing."
</blockquote>

I was really fascinated at what different athletes were listening to (and the impact their revelations had on the artists) still, something just nags at me about an Olympic sport where you can jam away on your favorite music <em>while</em> competing.  I wonder why none of the <a href="http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=CU">curlers</a> are sporting iPods?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Cubes Considered Harmful</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My apologies to Edsger W. Dijkstra but it's not like I'm the first to play off his classic <a href="http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/">Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a>.  Now, I doubt I'll ever have the pleasure of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BionicOffice.html">offices like Joel's</a>, but when you consider how little work it really takes to truly craft a space that enables developer productivity...well, I just don't understand why someone hasn't done something about it.

But then I remember this quote from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/index.html">Paul Graham</a> "Big companies think the function of office space is to express rank" (in the essay <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">Great Hackers</a>).  Clearly, that's been the case everywhere I've worked.  At my last company, there were strict rules about who could have an office and thus a door (VP and above) and who could have windows (AVP - no window, VP - one window, SVP - you could get a corner office).  Heck, the code even covered the types of chairs you could order!  How absurd is that?  It doesn't matter if you space is productive or not - it just has to designate your place in the food chain.  Graham continues (my emphasis): 

<blockquote>But hackers use their offices for more than that: they use their office as a place to think in. And if you're a technology company, <strong>their thoughts are your product</strong>. So making hackers work in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory where the air is full of soot.</blockquote>


This is part of the point I was trying to make in <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/18/you-have-11-minutes/">You Have 11 Minutes</a> - the modern office just doesn't adequately meet the needs of the typical knowledge worker.

Maybe we finally have some ammunition though - something that managers can actually quantify.  Apparently, <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/02/brain_death_by_.html">cubes make us dumber</a>.  Perhaps this quote from <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a> will get their attention (my emphasis):

<blockquote>You always knew that dull, boring cubicles could suck the joy out of work, but now there's evidence that they can change your brain. Not mentally or emotionally, no, we're talking <strong>physical structural changes</strong>. You could almost say, "Dull, lifeless work environments cause brain damage."</blockquote>

<a href="http://webscript.princeton.edu/~psych/psychology/research/gould/index.php">Elizabeth Gould</a> has some striking research that basically says "Complex surroundings create a complex brain."  Gould's work indicates that we should have a far more dynamic and stimulating environments than the bland cubes that most of us toil in everyday.

I'm reminded of a trainer I had once that used to work at <a href="http://www.nike.com/main.html">Nike</a> (I must confess - I <strong>*love*</strong> the <a href="http://www.theolucius.nl.com/nikewall2.gif">swoosh</a>...).  He said that the shoe designers had very cool office space.  They all had tons of squishy toys, there were lots of bright colors, and it was very "non traditional".  Of course it was only the designers that had what I'll call functional space - everyone else had boring beige.  Some will be quick to say "the designers are different, they're creative types" and I'd be the first to agree - but don't most 21st century knowledge occupations require innovation and imagination?

What if you were building a new factory to produce widgets?  Do you think you <em>might</em> want your manufacturing line to be as ergonomic and efficient as possible?  If it resulted in greater productivity, you sure would; even if it meant some extra up front cost.  Yet for some reason, we don't apply this same logic to those of us that create ideas instead of widgets - I wonder if that will ever change.  Imagine what would happen if a company actually put their workers in a <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/06/square-peg-round-hole/">position to excel</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm constantly <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/03/a-sensible-answer-to-drm/">amazed</a> at the content industries and their inability to adapt to new technology.  Rather than find a way to profit from the shift, entities like the RIAA and the MPAA do what they do best and lobby government to castrate the encroaching technology.  Of course this rarely works as <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/14/why_publishing_shoul.html">says</a> "bits will never, ever get any harder to copy than they are today".  Now, I was resigned to the fact that Hollywood would fight tooth and nail and we'd have some kind of <a href="http://www.eff.org/broadcastflag/three_minute_guide.php">broadcast flag</a> however, I ran into something today that gives me a glimmer of hope.

<a href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/">Clive Thompson</a>  posted <a href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2006/02/three_years_ago.html">this piece</a> about how KFC is actually using Tivo to their advantage!  Rather then bemoan consumers ability to skip commercials, they've chosen to embrace the fact that people will fast forward by embedding a subliminal message that gives you a secret code for a free sandwich!  I hope this is a measure of things to come.  Think this approach <em>might</em> work a bit better than trying to change the technology?

Along the same lines, I hope more people follow the NBC's lead and release some of their content for free.  Think a few people might give <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Conviction/">Conviction</a> a try if they can <a href="http://www.micropersuasion.com/2006/02/nbc_pilots_conv.html">download it gratis</a>?  Sounds an awful lot like Cory Doctorow's <a href="http://www.craphound.com/down/archives/2003_01.php#000018">approach to his books</a>...obscurity is a bigger deal than piracy.  As Seth Godin <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/02/free_for_now_fr.html">points out</a> "Getting people to PAY attention is enough for most media companies."  Compare that to Ricky Gervais; his <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/rickygervais">podcast</a> (which is pretty funny) is now in the Guinness Book of World Records for the <a href="http://www.rickygervais.com/guinnessrecord.php">most downloaded podcast</a>.  Pretty impressive stuff.  How does he choose to follow that up?  By <strong><a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/news/2006/02/20/ricky_gervais_podcast_paid/">charging</a></strong> people for the next one.  Think he'll get three million downloads at $7 a month?  Once again, I agree with <a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/bits/2006/02/27/cory_doctorow_interview/2.html">Doctorow</a>.  There is an awful lot of great free content out there - to break through that, Gervais will have to offer something truly compelling.  I wish him luck.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> has a great post: "<a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/02/how_to_prevent_.html">How to Prevent a Bozo Explosion</a>".  How many is your company guilty of?  What about <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scoble</a>'s <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/02/26/is-your-company-seeing-a-bozo-explosion/">additions</a>?  More importantly - what are you doing about it?

I hate to admit how many of these I've seen over the years but there are some great messages in these posts.  I've been very intrigued by the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/20/what-can-you-do-without/">concept</a>  of <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/constraints_breed_breakthrough_creativity.php">constraints</a> and what they <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/08/cut-the-fat/">can mean</a> to a software organization (see Kathy's <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/creativity_on_s.html">post</a> for more).  One lesson of the bubble - growing <strong>REALLY</strong> big <strong>REALY</strong> fast with <strong>LOTS</strong> of cash isn't the answer...  I also think Guy's advice about looking beyond the resume is important - how many great candidates to you think Google has flushed because they didn't go to the right school?

There were a couple of bits in Robert's additions that really caught my eye especially the one about changing the spec...  And I think you know where I stand on <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/26/make-meetings-useful/">meetings</a>!]]></content:encoded>

Needless to say, we've spiked a tad on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&s=books">Amazon</a>...  Tip of the cap to <a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/blogs/brentashley/">Brent Ashley</a> for being the first to fill me in (hey, I was at lunch with the lads when it was posted) and thanks to those that emailed me - I appreciate the kind words!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, Ryan and I spoke at <a href="http://www.uwlax.edu/">UW La Crosse</a>.  The event was fantastic and we had a blast - special thanks to <a href="http://www.cs.uwlax.edu/~kasi/">Dr. Kasi Periyasamy</a> and the <a href="http://www.cs.uwlax.edu/">Computer Science</a> club for inviting us down!  The event was recorded and I'm hoping to post the audio (maybe even the video...we'll see) but in the meantime, here's the <a href="/slides/Foundations of Ajax UWL.pdf">slide deck</a>.  <a href="http://www.backupbrain.com/">Dori</a> would be happy to know that nearly half (yes half) of the attendees were women!

Since some people were very interested in the links, I'm also posting both the <a href="/slides/Ajax and the Enterprise.pdf">paper</a> and the set of <a href="/slides/code freeze links.rtf">links</a> from my talk at <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/16/code-freeze-slides/">Code Freeze</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been a fan of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> for some time now and I get really excited when my blog reader says they've posted something new.  Today they covered a topic near and dear to my heart with a piece entitled <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/gettingstartedwithajax">Getting Started with Ajax</a> which does a great job of covering the basics.  Of course I was particularly pleased to see that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&#038;s=books">Foundations of Ajax</a> was listed in the Ajax Resources section!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but I have a hard time getting excited about Office - sure, I use Word, Excel and PowerPoint daily but for the last, well, decade, there really hasn't been anything to get too worked up about.  That said, today I watched something that really got my attention.  While I realize this isn't the freshest of news items, the video from <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> (gotta love <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Robert Scoble</a>) on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=114720">Office 12</a> has been kicking around our offices lately and to tell you the truth - it really is quite something (maybe not quite as exciting as the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/14/the-future-of-user-interfaces/">multi touch interface</a>, but c'mon, this is a business application).  The live preview idea is fantastic; (feels rather Ajaxy if I do say so myself!) I can't tell you how many times I've done something only to hit Undo...  I also really like the clean UI - it sure looks like it's a much better approach.  Bravo!

For more information, check out <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/uioverview.mspx">this overview</a> from Microsoft as well as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/default.aspx">Jensen Harris</a>' posts: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/03/07/545300.aspx">The Long Road to Contextual Tabs</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2005/09/16/468365.aspx">It's All About Context</a>.  Say what you will about MS but they've got some really bright people and some of the best usability folks around - and for the first time in, well, forever, I'm actually excited about upgrading!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Becoming an Expert</title>
		<link>http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/11/becoming-an-expert/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last week or so, I read two interesting articles about what it takes to become an expert.  There is a perception that, to be really good at something, you have to start when you are two; I think most of us have seen those cute pictures of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods">Tiger Woods</a> as a kid and naturally assume that the reason he's where he is today is the head start combined with his all-world athleticism.  While there's no doubting his athletic talent and the early start, <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P335/shanks_expertise.html">Outstanding Performers: Created, Not Born?</a> points to a different conclusion.

David Shanks says that practice plays a much larger role.  He points to one study that says the best musicians simply practiced more:

<blockquote>Each of the musicians was asked to estimate approximately how many hours a week they had practiced each year since the outset of their musical training, and these estimates yielded cumulative totals of about 10,000 hours for the best musicians, followed by 8,000 for the next best ones and 5,000 for the least accomplished. </blockquote>

People forget that Tiger has spent literally thousands of hours hitting golf balls on the range, practicing his silky putting stroke, and chipping and pitching around the practice green.  Talent obviously helps (some athletes are renowned for what they <em>don't</em> do during the off-season...) but while we can't all be born with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Griffey,_Jr.">Ken Griffey, Jr.</a>'s hand eye coordination, each one of us can carve out the time (well, maybe that's not so easy).

<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a> echos this theme in <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/03/how_to_be_an_ex.html">How to be an expert</a> (her emphasis).

<blockquote>The only thing standing between you-as-amateur and you-as-expert is <em><strong>dedication</strong></em>. All that talk about <em>prodigies</em>? We could all be prodigies (or nearly so) if we just put in the time and focused. At least that's what the brain guys are saying. Best of all--<em>it's almost never too late</em>.
</blockquote>

So, if you want to be good at something - dedicate the time to do so.  Somewhere (can't recall exactly where) I read that, if you study something for one hour a day for three years, you would be an expert.  I can hear you now, where am I supposed to get an hour?  Well, for a bit or perspective, 7 hours a week amounts to just over <strong>four percent of your week</strong>.  Considering the average adult male <a href="http://www.state.sd.us/doh/Nutrition/TV.pdf">watches close to</a> <em>30 hours of TV</em> in that same period, I'm guessing we could all cut back a bit.  Of course if you've read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1573223077%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1141268242%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">Everything Bad is Good for You</a>, maybe you'll disagree!

But Kathy highlights another important point in her piece - it's never too late to start.  We're <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy">living longer</a> than ever so saying "I'm already 30/40/50/60 etc" doesn't cut it (well, unless you want to be, say an Olympic gymnast).  To quote Kathy again (her emphasis):

<blockquote>...actress Geena Davis nearly qualified for the US Olympic archery team <em>in a sport she took up at the age of 40, less than three years before the Olympic tryouts</em>.
</blockquote>

What's your excuse again?

The moral of the story - we can become experts if we are willing to put in the time but more importantly, we don't need to begin as babies.  My advice?  Start now.  In three years you'll be three years older - you can either be three years older and and on your way to becoming an expert or you can be, well, three years older.  Which would you rather be?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>An End To Boring Speakers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I read Jay Lehr's <a href="http://www.geol.wwu.edu/rjmitch/stoning.pdf">Let There Be Stoning</a>, I figured he was channeling <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a>...but then I realized he wrote it in 1985.  With quotes like this, I think I can be forgiven for my my mistake:

<blockquote>Let there be an end to incredibly boring speakers!  They are not sophisticated, erudite scientists speaking above our intellectual capability; they are arrogant, thoughtless individuals who insult our very presence by the lack of concern for our desire to benefit from a meeting which we choose to attend.
</blockquote>

In other words, they spend too much time trying to convince the audience how smart they were and not enough on how to help their users kick ass!  I certainly can't speak for Kathy, but I think she would support Jay in the shaming of poor presenters.  I also like this line:

<blockquote>[the speaker] must convey enlightened enthusiasm for his subject and the advances he has attained.
</blockquote>


Now, I've never read anything about bad foils (though I did have a CIO that used transparencies for all of his presentations...) but he takes a shot at those folks that think their audience can't read - in other words, <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/03/calling_an_audi.html">call an audible</a>.  For a comparison, you may want to read Kathy's take on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/06/kill_your_prese.html">deadly presentations</a>. 

<blockquote>A scientist who cannot retain in his head the essence of his latest work can hardly be said to be enraptured by his subject.</blockquote>

My only complaint...the PDF is password protected meaning the good old copy and paste doesn't work.  Sigh.  Way to go <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/">Presentation Zen</a> for <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/03/no_excuse_for_t.html">linking</a> to this article - it should be required reading for technical presenters!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today marks Day 1 of the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=47">Twin Cities</a> edition of the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">NFJS North American</a> tour!  What a difference a year makes; clearly, the word is getting out on NF in my circles.  Last year, I didn't know a soul at the event but this year, it <em>seemed</em> like I ran into someone I knew everywhere I turned.  Of course it helped that I brought 2 coworkers but while standing inline to register just in front of me I discovered none other Andy Madigan!  I couldn't believe it, but it's been two years already since he moved on to <a href="http://west.thomson.com/store/default.asp?cookie%5Ftest=1">West</a>.  We didn't have a ton of time to chat but hopefully we'll catch up at lunch tomorrow or Sunday.  Of course I knew my friends Joe Athman and <a href="http://jroller.com/page/GearDaddie">John Shields</a> would be there but I wasn't expecting to see my favorite Java programmer Christine Simon!  She went to some of the JSF tutorials I went to so we had a good chunk of time to chat.  Still, I <strong>*really*</strong> wanted to spend a couple of hours catching up with my old mates!

Just when I thought I couldn't possibly run into anyone else I knew, there before me was Jeanette Takaoka-Miles!  Jeanette is probably 80% of the reason I earned two of my <a href="http://www.sun.com/training/certification/java/">certs</a>...alas I didn't have much time to talk - hopefully tomorrow!  In the break after the first session, I ran into <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Instructors/Default.aspx?InstructorID=6">Jeff Jensen</a> of <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JavaUserGroup.aspx">TC JUG</a> fame.  Speaking of which, Ryan and I will be back at TC JUG in <a href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Resource/JUGPresentation.aspx?TopicID=102">July</a>.  Before dinner, I had a chance to say hi to <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/">Venkat Subramaniam</a> coauthor of the fantastic <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/02/16/practices-of-an-agile-developer/">Practices of an Agile Developer</a> - I didn't get to any of his talks today but he's first on my list for tomorow!  I know there were a couple of other friendly faces but they escape me after a 17 hour day!

Some general thoughts about today.  First, while I'm really pumped about the sessions I've been to/am planning on, I have to admit when I saw the names that wouldn't be here, I was really disappointed.  No <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a>, <a href="http://www.j2life.com/">Bruce Tate</a>, <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a>, <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn Vanderburg</a>, or <a href="http://howardlewisship.com/blog/">Howard Lewis Ship</a>.  I was also a bit surprised that the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_agenda.jsp?showId=47">agenda</a> shows only one talk on <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=245">Rails</a> and not a Ruby talk to be found...  Still, we've got a good crop with <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/dgeary">David Geary</a>, <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs">Justin Gehtland</a>, the afore mentioned  Venkat Subramaniam, and local boy <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=23">David Hussman</a> among others.  As I mentioned earlier, the word is out - and we've got a packed house!  The venue is good though I was surprised that I didn't see any laptops in action - maybe there just aren't that many bloggers in the big Minnie.  Speaking of which, every presenter I saw today was using a Mac and IntelliJ IDEA...

So what did I actually see on day 1?  Well, I was all about <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/">JSF</a> meaning I can recite David Geary's bio slide (and an impressive one it is I might add).  I attended <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=246">JavaServer Faces: A Whirlwind Tour</a>, <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=247">JSF: State of the Art</a>, and <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=18">Shale: Turbo-charge your JSF Apps</a>.  I don't know a ton about JSF but I've been intrigued ever since I first hear about it...back in 2001.  Though announced at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/">JavaOne</a> in 2001, it wasn't released until 2004 however it hasn't taken off until quite recently.  David has seen a steady stream of consulting and training of JSF for the past 6-9 months so maybe we're finally getting some momentum behind this approach.

David's second talk focussed on <a href="http://myfaces.apache.org/">Apache Tomahawk</a> (JSF components), <a href="https://facelets.dev.java.net/">Facelets</a> (Tapestry like views for JSF), and <a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/seam">Seam</a> (JSF marries EJB 3.0).  Though a good introduction to these technologies, I had to wonder what pain these eased for developers.  It seemed like the JSF components are a real free for all (especially now that <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/htdocs/faq_adffaces_apache.html">Oracle's ADF is part of the mix</a>).  And while I'm still holding out a glimmer of hope for <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pfd/jsr220/index.html">EJB 3</a>, I had to laugh when David flashed <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Gavin King</a>'s quote from a <a href="http://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=59304">Java Posse interview</a> where he said Seam was inspired by <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>!  I'm sorry, but putting Rails and EJB into the same sentence just made me laugh...

David's last talk focused in on <a href="http://struts.apache.org/struts-shale/">Shale</a>.  Now, this talk got my attention.  First, Apache's <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/validator/">Commons Validator</a> is <strong>*very*</strong> slick indeed.  I'd worked with it indirectly at my last job and I really liked it but it sure seems to have grown!  The ability to specify client and server side checking was way cool.  Though the support for annotations didn't do a ton for me, I was pretty excited to see how Ajax played with JSF (hard to believe, I know); using Shale made Ajax very simple...almost like cheating.  Support for Tapestry like views was interesting but the ability to create wizards and control navigation via web flows really caught my eye.

After dinner, <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a> of <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/index.html">ThoughtWorks</a> gave the keynote on Language Oriented Programming which is really just a fancy way of saying Domain Specific Languages.  Though not nearly as engaging or inspirational as Dave Thomas' <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/articles/ArtInProgramming.pdf">The Art in Computer Programming</a> talk, none the less it was thought provoking.  Neal showed <a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/MPS/JetBrains+MPS+Download+Page">JetBrains MPS</a> in action and I have to say, the ability to define a language for complex rules that my customers could easily use is quite tempting.  Still, I haven't quite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool-Aid#.22Drinking_the_Kool-Aid.22">drunk the Kool-Aid</a> on this one yet...  That said, when you see how hard it is to write a DSL in Java, it starts to make you wonder how much longer Java has.  Speaking of which one of my coworkers asked one of the speakers about Java vs. Ruby - he said <strong>*all*</strong> of his work is now in Ruby/Rails.  So, for those of you that think there's no money there, well, you're wrong.  But then you <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_j2r/index.html">don't need me</a> to tell you that.

Whew - I can't promise I'll get around to providing greater detail than this (I took surprisingly few notes, either that or the pages I'm using this year are narrow ruled) but it's getting late and I have a full day tomorrow!]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[[...] On Saturday, I had the distinct pleasure of presenting Foundations of Ajax and Pragmatic Usability at the Central Iowa Software Symposium. As regular readers know, I&#8217;ve attended NFJS events in the past (take a look at my thoughts on this year&#8217;s MN show: day 1, day 2, day 3 and of course quotes) but this was my first go at actually presenting. If you&#8217;ve ever attended a NF event, you know how outstanding the speakers are so I was really honored when Jay Zimmerman gave me the green light! Based on the feedback I received, I think I held my own which is saying quite a bit when you&#8217;re sandwiched by the likes of David Hussman, Venkat Subramaniam, Glenn Vanderburg and a host of outstanding technical minds.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm fairly confident that many of my readers are also on my qotd (quote of the day) list (and if you're not, but would like to be, just drop me a note or post a comment) so you know how much I dig quotes.  Needless to say, <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/index.jsp">NFJS</a> has provided a number of interesting quips - here are some highlights.  These are mostly accurate though I wouldn't swear on a Bible that they are verbatim.

<em>Proof that JavaScript (and dynamic languages in general) are finally starting to be treated as first class citizens...</em>  Overhead in the (rather inadequate) restrooms.
<blockquote>"Two years ago, if you'd have told me that I'd give up a weekend and spend $600 to learn JavaScript, I'd have laughed at you."
</blockquote>

<em>The first one's free...</em>  <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs">Justin Gehtland</a> in the Spring/AOP "birds of a feather" session.
<blockquote>"Spring is the free vial of crack [for Aspect Oriented Programming]...next thing you know, you're mainlining the stuff."
</blockquote>

<em>Compiler?  I don't need no stinking compiler...</em>  Mr. Gehtland again (though he may have been quoting someone else).
<blockquote>"In two years, we'll all look at compilers like slow, broken unit tests."</blockquote>

That's all for tonight...must rest up for the last day!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As much as I wanted to get this posted, you know, Saturday, I just didn't have time.  After the birds of a feather, I spent a good bit of time chatting with <a href="http://relevancellc.com/blogs/index.php">Justin Gehtland</a> about Ajax, Ruby, and Mac tricks so my whole evening was delayed.  Of course after spending 10 hours drinking down the tech love, I just couldn't convince myself to open the laptop.  Speaking of which, I'm a bit behind on my email and whatnot so if you don't hear from me for a couple of days, my apologies!  Though the BoF started as a <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">AOP</a> discussion, it devolved into a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>/<a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby</a> and why <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">Mac</a>'s are better talk.  I asked what would be more likely in two years - that we'd all be using AOP or we'd be programming in Ruby; needless to say, this got quite rise out of Justin!  BTW, for those of you that think <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs/?p=92">there's no money</a> to be made with Ruby...well, just ask Justin what he's been up to these days (and they are some impressive apps!)

On the people front, I ran into a few more folks I knew including <a href="http://www.citronellasoftware.com/">Mike Calvo</a> (I swear, he asked a great question in every session he was in) and I also had a chance to chat with <a href="http://www.sgfco.com/">David Hussman</a> - what a great guy!  You know, this year I really found myself wishing for more time between sessions to talk with people.  Anyway, on to the show...

I began my day with <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/">Venkat</a>'s <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=287">refactoring</a> talk and as I expected, it was great!  I really can't say enough good things about Venkat's presentation style - it really is a pleasure.  I especially liked his reference to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0060006641%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1142906862%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">On Writing Well</a> and its principles of simplicity, clarity, brevity, and most importantly, humanity.  I couldn't help but think that we spend way too much of our time worrying about the computer when in truth we need to write for our fellow developers.  I like to follow the homicidal maniac theory - in other words, I pretend that the person maintaining my code is a serial killer and he knows where I live so on the off chance he's digging through my code at 2 am, I'd like him to think happy thoughts about me.  Anyway, as I expected a great talk with live coding (damn, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> is sweet).

After that, I sat in on Justin Gehtland's talk on <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=342">JavaScript</a>.  I have to admit, I was quite interested to see Justin in person.  You see on <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/17/nfjs-day-1/">Day 1</a>, I spent my entire afternoon in the break out room next to his and all I have to say is, the man is <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">passionate</a>!  A couple of times I swear he was channeling <a href="http://www.emerils.com/">Emeril</a> (<strong>BAM!</strong>) and I even detected a couple of <a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/CNBCTV/TV_Info/P108231.asp">Jim Cramer</a>-esque <strong>BOOYAs</strong>...  Needless to say, I was <strong>*not*</strong> disappointed.  I <em>cannot</em> say enough good things about Justin (and I'm not just saying that because  he recommends our book.)  Not only did he fill me on his Mac must haves (<a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, <a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Utilities/Desktop-Manager.shtml">Desktop Manager</a>, and <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>) but he's also a foody!  We both share a passion for cooking, <a href="http://foodtv.com/">FoodTV</a> and <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/">Alton Brown</a>.  If you <strong>*ever*</strong> have a chance to see Justin live (like, say, <a href="http://railsconf.org/talks/selected/show/100">RailsConf</a>), do not hesitate.

In the afternoon is was back to the phenomenal <a href="http://jroller.com/page/dgeary">David Geary</a> for <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=250">Ajaxian Faces</a> and <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=245">Hands on Rails</a>.  In both sessions, David did a fair amount of live coding and it was impressive.  Sure, I know he had a lot of the code hiding in IntelliJ's smart templates and what not but still...pretty darn impressive.  Of course how he handled things <em>not</em> working was quite something - very cool under pressure.  I enjoyed watching someone else covering Ajax and I'm becoming more and more impressed with <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/">JSF</a> but I'm not quite ready to <a href="http://timshadel.com/2006/01/19/jsf-the-7-layer-burrito-i-wont-eat-again/">eat the 7-layer burrito</a>...  Of course the Rails session was amazing but I was surprised by two things - how few people actually went (I really expected a packed room) and the fact that there was only one session the entire weekend on Ruby and Rails combined...  No matter how many times I see it, Rails still impresses me.  When you watch someone code an entire application, live, in just a few minutes, well, it gets your attention.

Couple of other comments on David Geary's talks.  First, he takes advantage of a great Mac feature - the Universal Access panel - to magnify portions of his screen so folks in the back could read the code.  Rather than tweak his font settings, he just zoomed in!  Very slick - I am going to have to use this next time I present code.  Another interesting point, David has a fascinating hobby - French.  Yes, he has his language set not to English, but to French...  Way cool!

Well, I think that about covers Day 2...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whew...I'm starting to get caught up (well, not with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&#038;s=books">Foundations of Ajax</a> account!)  By Sunday, I was plenty tuckered out - but I powered through.  I had a good chat at breakfast with a few guys, talked about productivity and off-shoring and all that fun stuff and after one of the sessions, I had a great chat with Software Ninja Peter Pascale.  Like I <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/20/nfjs-day-2/">said earlier</a>, one of my favorite parts of these get togethers is the time between sessions when you get a chance to talk with your peers and compare notes.  We might not be in the heart of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, but there is a lot of exciting stuff going on in the Twin Cities!

OK, so on Sunday, I branched out a bit.  I started my day with <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/">Andrew Glover</a>'s <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=314">Practical Groovy</a>.  Now, I'm all for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic languages</a> and I'm convinced that the future of Java is as a platform: in the near future, we will have our choice of scripting languages (like <a href="http://jruby.sourceforge.net/">JRuby</a>, <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a>, <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>) on the JVM (or CLR <a href="http://www.ironpython.com/">if you prefer</a>).  This will allow us to start our applications in a more nimble language and then, <em>when we need to</em>, take advantage of the enterprise stack.  This means we can avoid most of the complexity that comes along with a language for <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/193146.htm">interplanetary navigation</a> until we need it allowing us to be far more productive.  But don't just take my word for it - <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> thinks <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/02/LAMP-Java-Sun">this will happen</a> too.  And like <a href="http://jroller.com/page/obie">Obie Fernandez</a>, I hope I'll be able to <a href="http://jroller.com/page/obie?entry=java_as_a_platform_for">deploy Rails on the JVM.</a>...and it better be before 2008!

Anyway, while some think that Groovy is the answer, it's hard to tell.  A few weeks back I read a pretty good write up (alas, I can't find it...sigh) about how stagnant Groovy was and that it was suffering from neglect.  That said, <a href="http://rmh.blogs.com/weblog/">Richard Monson-Haefel</a>  thinks it's a <a href="http://rmh.blogs.com/weblog/2006/02/groovy_the_slee.html">sleeping giant</a>.  With that backdrop, I was quite interested in seeing Groovy in action and I have to say, it looks pretty slick.  I'm a bit concerned about the whole binary compatibility issue as well as its <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=241">JSR</a> status, but a familiar syntax isn't such a bad thing.  Of course this has caused some symbol refactoring as the language matures...  While I'm not convinced that Groovy is the answer, it certainly does have it's place.  Andrew had some great examples where he's used Groovy in a production environment and I even suggested it for an issue at work (which prompted a comment along the lines of "crazy workaround" but whatever).

Anyway, after a host of pure tech, I needed to focus on the soft side so I went to <a href="http://www.sgfco.com/">David Hussman</a>'s <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=261">Losing Battles and Winning Wars: Adopting Agile</a>.  If you <strong>*ever*</strong> have a chance to see David live, take it, he is a dynamic speaker and very engaging.  And unlike many speakers, he will actually admit mistakes he's made in the past!  I'm doing everything I can to make my current employer more agile so I look to David for inspiration.  This was a fun talk - we discussed a lot of issues that various attendees had at their companies.  Unlike some, David doesn't advocate a whole sale conversion to agile; it's much more important to figure out what is important to the culture.  For some projects, unit testing just isn't practical, however, there are other practices that can be put into place.

My afternoon was all about testing and code quality with Andrew's <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=244">Unit Testing Best Practices</a> and <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=103">Taking Quality to the Next Level through Code Coverage Analytics</a>.  While Andrew is a great speaker (very clean slides though I would have appreciated a bio) I have to admit his Best Practices talk was a bit of a disappointment.  Truthfully, it was more of a survey of alternative testing tools like <a href="http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/">DbUnit</a>, <a href="http://clarkware.com/software/JUnitPerf.html">JUnitPerf</a>, and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit-addons">JUnit-addons</a>.  Still, he did eventually get to some best practices!  Some tests will take longer to run than others and the frequency of running this tests should be based on that fact.  I would have liked a bit more of that type of content though...

The Code Coverage session was pretty cool.  I've always wanted to play around with <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA</a> and/or <a href="http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/">Cobertura</a> but I've never gotten around to it.  The key point: don't trust a report that says you have 100% coverage!  While the tools can give you an idea of where you lack tests, if you rely on a "passing grade" from a coverage tool, you will be disappointed.  A good session, but you could tell the audience was pretty tired...and did I mention how hard the seats were?

All in all, a great conference!  While not an "event" like <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/">JavaOne</a>, <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">NFJS</a>, is a excellent learning experience and if you actually want to <em>talk</em> with the presenters, you should give them a look.  It should tell you something that I returned for a second go and this year lots of my circle went too.  I can't wait for next year's event (though I'd love to be on the other side of the podium)!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm not sure about you, but on more than one occasion, I've been asked to write a confirmation dialog.  As a UI guy, I usually push back since most people get into the habit of clicking through them so the one time the mean to hit "No" it's too late, muscle memory has already sent their work to oblivion.  Anyway, the other day Joe Athman sent me a link to <a href="http://www.d3eministry.net/wordpress/">Joe Vasquez</a>'s article <a href="http://www.d3eministry.net/wordpress/2006/03/23/147/">AJAX Delete Confirmation</a> pointing out that the author mentions <a href="http://taconite.sourceforge.net/">Taconite</a>!  Thanks Joe for writing about our little framework (and thanks to Joe for forwarding the link on to me).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Thursday, my wife and I hopped into the car and made the journey back my alma mater, <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/">St. John's University</a> where I gave a talk about Ajax.  <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~mheroux/">Mike Heroux</a> was kind enough to invite me up and I really enjoyed chatting with my old (you know what I mean!) adviser <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~jschnepf/">Jim Schnepf</a> (sorry I couldn't summon a wittier dedication), <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~jmiller/">John Miller</a>, and <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~jholey/">Andy Holey</a>.  My four years at SJU were a real highlight for me and every time I go back behind the Pine Curtain is special.  The talk was great, we had a good crowd that asked some great questions so thanks to everyone that attended!  And clearly I forgot just how <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/record/archives/2004-2005/10-07-04/variety/pizza_wars.html">good Gary's Pizza</a> is...

Anywho, here are the <a href="/slides/Foundations of Ajax SJU.pdf">slides</a> from my talk and for those of you that weren't there, a <a href="/slides/Ajax and the Enterprise.pdf">paper</a> that might help fill in the gaps a bit and a copy of the <a href="/slides/code freeze links.rtf">links</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just when you think <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> has added every service imaginable, they announce <a href="http://www.google.com/romance/">Google Romance</a>.  Using special search algorithms and Contextual Dating, even geeks can now find love.  Seriously, if we let Google organize our most personal files and emails, why not our love life?  Quoting the <a href="http://www.google.com/romance/press.html">press release</a>: 

<blockquote>"Our mission, as you might have heard, is to organize the world's information," said Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's senior vice president, product management. "And let's face it: in what area of life is the world's information more disorganized than romance? We thought we could use our search technology to help you find that special someone, then send you on a date and use contextual ads to help you, ya know - close the deal."

</blockquote>

Thanks to targeted ads, you even get a free romantic evening out of the deal - man, how do you beat a free date?  I'm sure this will take off so you better <a href="http://www.google.com/romance/profile.html">upload your profile soon</a>, they'll probably experience huge demand and have to <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=pages&continue=http%3A%2F%2Fpages.google.com%2F">close off</a> the service for a while.  Man, it's amazing what those Google engineers dream up with their <a href="http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/static.py?page=about.html">20% projects</a>!  Oh...and in case you haven't figured this out yet...check the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fool's_Day">darn calendar</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What Did we Meet About?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've written about meetings on more than one occasion (<a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/26/make-meetings-useful/">here</a>, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/18/you-have-11-minutes/">here</a>, and <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/15/meetings-are-like-goldfish/">here</a>) but I recently ran into a very interesting article by <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/author/jared/">Jared Spool</a> called <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2006/03/30/the-one-minute-test/">The One-Minute Test</a>.  Jared describes a technique his team uses at the end of meetings to make sure that everyone is on the same page.  Given a 60 second time limit, every participant is asked to write down their answers to the following questions:



<blockquote><ol>
	<li>What was the big idea? (What was the most important thing you heard at the meeting?)
</li>
	<li>What was your big surprise? (What was the thing you saw or heard that surprised you the most?)
</li>
	<li>Whatâ€™s your big question? (Whatâ€™s the biggest unanswered question you have at this time?)
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>



Each person then share their answers with everyone else (or a moderator can read them as well)...and you can guess what often happens.  As expected, you can get some pretty diverse answers - answers that can often save you some trouble later.  How often have you walked out of a meeting assuming one thing only to discover that your coworker (or worse your boss) was assuming something totally different?  Has that every caused you some pain?

To me, this feels like something that David Allen (author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0142000280%2Fqid%3D1135446434%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fn%3D507846%2526s%3Dbooks%2526v%3Dglance">Getting Things Done</a>) might propose - it would certainly help flesh out the action items.  As much as I'd love to apply this approach to my work, our meetings are so packed, I can't imagine anyone being to keen on me carving off 10-15 minutes to discuss the meeting!  Though I think it might actually <em>save</em> time in the long run, I bet that'd be a tough sell...  Anyway, I thought this was a pretty interesting approach - one that I hope to employ at some point.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm glad you find the idea intriguing. The time it takes is a concern and, you're right, it could be valuable in the long run.

In its shortest form, it only takes a little more than a minute. You have people answer the three questions just as they leave the room. It doesn't give you a chance, at that moment, to discuss it, but that could happen later over email or someother medium.

I guess I'm saying I wouldn't let the time investment scare you from the technique.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments Jared!  I didn't really think about the email route (I've written email off a bit due to the amount of "noise" that comes through my inbox) but that would help mitigate some of the "that's not was I thought" issues.  I'm not saying that I would be afraid to use this approach but I suspect some of my coworkers would push back...of course it doesn't help that our meetings typically start late - which means they then run long leading to an entire day that is behind.  Anyway, thanks for taking the time to comment, I appreciate it!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've checked out my <a href="/jat/recent-reads/">recent reads</a> page, you'll notice that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1573223077%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1141268242%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">Everything Bad is Good for You</a> is near the top of the list.  First off, this is really a great book - one I highly recomend.  Now if you aren't familiar with the premise, you might be a bit put off, but <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/">Steve Johnson</a> essentially says that TV and video games might not be as bad for our brain as we think.  Of course he isn't advocating we all stop reading Shakespeare in favor of vegging out to the latest "reality" show but he has some really good points.  First, have you ever noticed the level of complexity found in today's most popular shows?  Just count the number of characters and plot lines in <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/">Lost</a>, <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a>, or <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/">Sopranos</a> and get back to me...

Yesterday I had lunch with one of my closest friends and on the way over I was listening to NPR (I know, it's yet another sign I'm getting older) when <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=2">All Things Considered</a> covered Nintendo's new game <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=tYVqJgro-KG6QL_mMbXFoQTkQIzgi9nU">Brain Age</a> (give a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5325726">listen here</a>).  Though only released in Japan (why is almost all the cool stuff released in Europe or Asia first?) the premise is that playing the game regularly will make you smarter.  Quite interesting stuff...  Shortly after I sent this link to frequent brain blogger <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a>, I ran into <a href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2006/04/_a_while_ago_th.html">Can a game make you smarter?</a> over on <a href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/">Clive Thompson</a>'s blog.  In this post, Clive points to his most <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,70487-1.html">recent Wired column</a> (along with a <a href="http://audio.sonibyte.com/audio/wired/259.mp3">podcast</a>) where he also touches on Brain Age and similar topics.  Of course Clive mentions Steve Johnson's book!  You've got to love convergence huh?

I'm certainly no expert on brains or games and I certainly think "today's youth" spend <strong>WAY</strong> too much time in the virtual world (told you I was getting older) but there's definitely something to this.  The future is rushing at us faster and faster - we aren't in Kansas anymore and the skills and techniques that we'll need to thrive (heck even cope) with the next 50 years are certainly different than those of the last 50.  We may not agree with some of the violence and attitudes displayed in games but considering the impact game technology is having on society, we best not dismiss it out of hand.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This little blog recently crossed some magic threshold - despite very few incoming links (sigh) I've recently been inundated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_spam">blog spam</a>.  When I first started this little project, I would occasionally have something waiting in <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>'s moderated comment area but things got so bad a few weeks back that I had to install a couple of plugins (thus why you'll now have to answer a simple math question to post a comment).  It appears that this has choked off the spammers and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause the three of you that occasionally comment here but I got tired of having to go in an delete three pages of crap...

Though completely unrelated, I've noticed the amount of spam coming into one of my accounts has gone up recently (not sure how that one was released to the wild but so be it).  While a nuisance, I really don't get how people get caught up in some of the schemes.  For instance, I've been getting a lot of mail warning me that my "online credit card" has high-risk activity on it.  Of course I'm not really sure what they mean by my online credit card (though I do indeed use one card primarily used for web based purchases) and they make a vague reference to my Chase Bank User Agreement...  While this is quite obviously fake, I can see why the body of the email *might* entice someone into clicking on the link however, don't people bother to look at the from address?  Does anyone honestly think that a real Chase rep would be emailing me from a freakin Yahoo account?  Never mind that there are several email addresses in the to line...  It really amazes me how easy it is to fool some people - though with email being essentially free, you don't need many people to fall for the trap.

I've also seen a recent twist on the "help us launder some money" scam.  This time, someone's father was killed on the way to see the family of the late president of Togo (amazingly, they actually reference a real person and the actual date of his death - even spammers can use the Internet for research!) and the family fled to somewhere in Africa (why is it always Africa? what's wrong with eastern Europe?)  For the privilege of stashing a cool 8.5 million I can get 20% of the take!  Wow, who could possibly pass that up?  Ahh the insanity.  And don't even get me started on the volumes of crap that come into our Foundations email account - seriously someone must have posted that somewhere.  Sigh.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/">Justin Gehtland</a> recently posted some reviews of the first round of Ajax books; for his take on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&s=books">Foundations of Ajax</a> click <a href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/04/10/relevance-review">here</a> (thanks to <a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/blogs/brentashley/">Brent Ashley</a> for pointing these out to me - Justin must have switched his RSS feed recently because I had to modify my subscription in <a href="http://bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>).  First off, I appreciate Justin's kind words about me personally and as I think is obvious from my <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/18/nfjs-quotes/">NF Quotes</a> post and my <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/20/nfjs-day-2/">summary of day 2</a> entry, the feeling is mutual!  All in all, I like Justin's take on the book and he's one of the few that really <strong>got</strong> what we were trying to do - Ryan and I have always felt that the real strengths of FoA are the tools chapters.  While IDEs are catching up, we're largely on our own when it comes to coding JavaScript - which is why we spent a good chunk of the book writing about the developer's toolbox.

As I mentioned in the <a href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/04/10/relevance-review#comments">comments</a>, we would have covered the libraries in more depth than a short appendix but at the time we wrote the book (nearly a year ago now...wow, time really flies) it really wasn't clear who the "winners" would be and while the space is still wide open, there is at least some consolidation around frameworks like <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>, and <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us</a>.  That said, we <strong>*will*</strong> be covering them (along with others) in our next book - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1590596773%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fqid%3D1145127903%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_2%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">Pro Ajax with Java</a> (more of that soon!).  If we ever write a second edition of FoA, we will certainly keep Justin's remarks in mind.

Anyway, thanks for the review Justin and I really hope we'll have some time to chat at <a href="http://www.railsconf.com/">RailsConf</a>!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Tuesday, Ryan and I had the distinct pleasure of <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/20060418.html">speaking</a> at the <a href="http://www.otug.org/">Object Technology User Group</a> (OTUG) - many thanks to Aleh Matus for having us.  If you've never checked out OTUG, I really recommend it.  They've had quite a string of amazing speakers including <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/20051115.html">Michael Feathers</a>, <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/20051018.html">Andy Hunt</a>, <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/20050920.html">Obie Fernandez</a>, <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/20050517.html">Gavin King</a>, <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/200404.html">Eric Evans</a>, and <a href="http://www.otug.org/meeting/200402.html">Martin Fowler</a>.  The gorgeous weather we've been having lately kept the crowd a little sparse but we got some great questions including "does Ajax scale" which I'll discuss in a bit.

There were some friendly faces in the crowd including my protege and former coffee buddy Joe Athman ('bout time you came, sorry you didn't win something), my manager Scott Rens along with those rabble rousers Jason Selby and Eric Vossler (apologies if I've misspelled any names).  <a href="http://taconite.sourceforge.net/">Taconite</a> user and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1437173&forum_id=474577">contributor</a> Eric Olson was also present - thanks for making the long drive, hope the weather held off!  We had a great time and really enjoyed ourselves - thanks to all that came.  Of course I was a little concerned that my <a href="http://csbsju.edu/">SJU</a> license plates would draw unwanted attention to my vehicle - after all, OTUG is hosted by arch rival St. Thomas...

Anyway, here are the <a href="/slides/Foundations of Ajax OTUG.pdf">slides</a> -  as usual, this is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 License</a>.

		<title>Ajax and Server Load</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/04/20/otug-slides/">OTUG on Tuesday</a>, we got the "but does it scale" question regarding Ajax; a topic that has actually come up at work in regards to the <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en">Google Suggest</a> functionality (incidentally, Joel's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/12/10.html">article about Google Suggest</a> first triggered my interest in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html">XHR</a> object).  Now, I've <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/11/19/death-by-a-thousand-cuts/">talked about this a bit</a> in the past and we basically said - of course it scales...if you do it right.  Obviously, Ajax can get "chatty" and I really do have some concerns about dozens of fine grained calls - to this end, I brought up the initial forays into EJB land that resulted in good old <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html">Data Transfer Objects</a>.  All in all, I'm of the opinion that Ajax <em>should</em> increase performance by lazily fetching data and, when properly architected, scale horizontally quite well.  Interestingly enough, it turns out that this very question is making its way around the blogosphere...

Today, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> posted <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/04/19/The-Cost-of-AJAX">The Cost of AJAX</a> where he refers to <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/001526.html">a post</a> from <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/">James Governor</a> essentially asking for thoughts about WebSphere guru <a href="http://www.devwebsphere.com/about.html">Billy Newport</a>'s recent writings.  Billy got things started with the innocently titled: <a href="http://www.devwebsphere.com/devwebsphere/2006/04/ajax_and_its_im.html">AJAX and its impact on servers</a>.  Now, I've tracked Billy's blog on and off (I worked on WebSphere based apps for many years) but I'm not really sure what he's basing this quote on: 

<blockquote>I think it's becoming clear now that AJAX enabled applications generate a higher load on an application server than a non AJAX application.</blockquote>

Really?  Considering that <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> ran on <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/samples/37s-scale-later.pdf">one server for its first year</a>, I'm curious what causes him to make a statement like that.  I'm not saying there isn't some truth to it, but I haven't been hearing any screaming about this issue; I'm not sure, but I suspect Gmail gets a few hits a day and it seems to be doing OK...  Of course maybe he's just trying to sell more IBM gear ;) 

<blockquote>Distributed caching is a critical piece of the toolkit to help with this. Technologies like ObjectGrid allow an application server to pull data from a remote ObjectGrid cluster in under a ms.</blockquote>

In the followup <a href="http://www.devwebsphere.com/devwebsphere/2006/04/the_hidden_cost.html">The hidden costs of lazy fetch with AJAX</a>, Billy once again plugs ObjectGrid but he also challenges us to consider patterns for client/server interaction (might I suggest <a href="http://softwareas.com/">Michael Mahemoff</a>'s <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/">AjaxPatterns</a> site).  Billy mentions that every database call has a fixed cost so executing more than is necessary can have a negative impact on your application.  But he rightly states this is nothing new - frankly, just like the security issues that occasionally crop up in the Ajax space.  Hey, this isn't rocket surgery, the same rules still apply.  Now that we can finally give our users a truly rich interface while still retaining the benefits of a server based app doesn't mean we can forget all the lessons we've learned the last decade.

So back to Tim who wanders in and points out that most web pages are already making multiple calls!  I especially like this quote:

<blockquote>So saying â€œAJAX is expensiveâ€ (or that itâ€™s cheap) is like saying â€œA mountain bike is slower than a battle tankâ€ (or that itâ€™s faster). The truth depends on what youâ€™re doing with it.</blockquote>

That said, I am interested in what Ajax means for load testing.  If we say our application needs to support 100 concurrent users, what happens when said users are making 20 calls each instead of say, 5?  Ajax isn't a cure for cancer and adding it to your application won't instantly make you the target of a takeover bid from Google.  But, used properly, it can significantly improve your user experience.  There's a chance you might have to add more hardware, but frankly that's a nice problem to have.

You know, what I really love about <a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/">Dilbert</a> is how <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/">Scott Adams</a> seems to be writing about things that are happening in my workplace when they happen...what I love about the blogosphere is how questions that come up in the course of my day are debated by the likes of Tim and Billy!  For whatever reason, this thread doesn't seem to have been picked up by the "major" Ajax sites but this is important stuff.  I echo calls from the comments to <a href="http://www.devwebsphere.com/devwebsphere/2006/04/ajax_and_its_im.html#c16288502">back up the claims with data</a> - but I'll leave you with this thought from <a href="http://www.josh-peters.name/blog/">Josh Peters</a>:

<blockquote>In the end though, it's really nothing new: unless you understand a technology you cannot expect to weild it well.</blockquote>

  Well said.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dietrich,

I agree that expectations are certainly rising and Ajax lets us move a lot closer to the thick client server apps that preceded the web explosion.  Still, I can't help but think the next step is closer to a XUL like approach.  Anyway, I'm just glad to see a resurgence in the web client space.  Thanks for the comment!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>More Ajax and Scalability</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, more than a few people have picked up on the various articles floating around regarding Ajax and scalability.  Thanks to Michael Mahemoff for reading <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ajax-and-scaleability">my piece</a> and reposting it (check the <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ajax-and-scaleability#comments">comments</a>). Stuart Halloway over on Relevance <a href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/04/21/ajax-and-server-scalability-theory-and-practice">also picked up on the thread</a> (alas he didn't notice my commentary...) and made a great point - the server vendors win in this game!  Interestingly, this is the second time in less than a week that I've read a variant of this quote (though it's not attributed in Stuart's article, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_reason">wikipedia</a>, it's Jan L. A. van de Snepscheut).  

<blockquote>In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.</blockquote>

Anyway, good call on the server vendors - they should all be lining up behind Ajax (is it a coincidence that <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1917665,00.asp">IBM leads</a> the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/atf/">Open Ajax</a> project?)  Dave Johnson also gets into the mix with <a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/dave/?p=121">Scaling AJAX</a>.  I liked his allusion to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145487/">Spider Man</a> but he made a great I was really glad to see him refer to the MacRumors post on <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/events/mwsf2006-stats.php">handling the Macworld keynote</a> (see the <a href="http://www.macrumorslive.com/about/">overview</a> as well).

It took a few days, but seems like this issue has gotten some visibility!
<strong>Update:</strong>

Scott over on the <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/blog/">Zimbra</a> blog has a great take on <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/blog/archives/2006/04/ajax_impact_on.html">Ajax and scaling</a>.  I particularly like referring to Ajax apps as "husky" as opposed to thin or thick and he's dead on with this comment:


<blockquote>In terms of its broader application architecture, the Web platform looks a lot more like a mainframe application: Yes, the 3270 green screen is replaced by a far richer browser and hypertext mark-up, but more of the UI and virtually all of the business logic (modulo Javascript field validation) is done on the server. </blockquote>


At one point, I had a CIO that called our web apps "lipstick on a pig" - we were <em>just</em> webifying mainframe apps...  That said, most of my customers really enjoyed not having a character limit to their screens!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The More Things Change...</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like any industry, ours likes to pretend that today's problems are new and unique - it's part of how we justify our salaries!  And while the demands on what we are expected to do with technology continues to exceed the gains made with improved languages and hardware, the more things change, the more they stay the same.  For example, take collaborative work environments.  With today's focus on outsourcing, far flung offices, and distributed supply chains, using technology to help distributed teams work together is a must.  While some people might think this is a relatively new phenomena, in truth, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">Douglas Engelbart</a> was working on this issue back in the early 60's.  A while back, I stumbled upon these two videos (<a href="http://vilter.us/homeschooling/alankay/alankaypt1.mp4">part 1</a> and <a href="http://vilter.us/homeschooling/alankay/alankaypt2.mp4">part 2</a> from <a href="http://vilter.us/homeschooling/">here</a>) of a presentation from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a> circa 1987.  About a third of the way through the first part, Kay shows a video of Engelbart demonstrating some really amazing stuff.  In the presentation, Engelbart works with a colleague located about 30 miles away - along with sharing the desktop, they've got full audio and video connectivity.  Needless to say, I was pretty wowed.

Further along, you see some amazing applications developed by school children!  While some of this may seem trivial today, you have to consider when this was filmed.  I've long been fascinated by novel ways technology is applied in the classroom - something beyond using a word processor or doing some research on the web.  I have to wonder what has become of programs like those discussed in this talk...

These days you can't swing a short iron without running into <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/technology/16wireless.html?ex=1302840000&en=76984460580ca72a&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">some discussion</a> of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=software+patents&btnG=Google+Search">patent law</a> and how it applies to software (or more often doesn't apply) but I was really surprised to hear it come up in the Q&A!  To paraphrase Alan, while he feels that protecting inventions is good, he's dead on when he says: "there is enormous confusion between whatâ€™s an idea and whatâ€™s an inventionâ€.  He argues that there should be some protection but that it can be (and is) abused.

A little later, he argues for a more than just a technical education and as a graduate of a <a href="http://csbsju.edu/">small liberal arts college</a>, I was very pleased to hear him urge computer scientists to get a liberal arts background.  He argues that the challenge is to find the aesthetic.  Frankly, I think my BA in computer science makes me a far more well rounded individual and has allowed me to perform a wider variety of duties.  For instance, these days I spend a lot of my time moderating meetings and giving presentations - with a strictly technical background, I might not be quite as adept playing that role.

Anyway, a very fascinating presentation by a giant of computing.  I highly recommend you take the time to watch these; despite their age, they are still quite timely.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I meant to mention this a bit earlier...but a few weeks back, Ryan and I recorded a podcast with <a href="http://fosterburgess.com/wp/">Mike Kimsal</a> over at <a href="http://www.webdevradio.com/index.php">WebDevRadio</a> and it is available <a href="http://www.webdevradio.com/index.php?id=34">here</a>.  The sound quality is pretty good (at least we sound more normal than the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/?p=98">talk we gave at UWL</a>!) and we had a great conversation on how we got into this, our background, why the server code is always in Java, the challenges in the Ajax space, etc.  The entire interview is a bit over an hour - many thanks to Mike for interviewing us, it was a blast!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>NetBeans Day</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/index.html">NetBeans</a> guy, I was pretty jazzed to attend NetBeans day held just before <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/">JavaOne</a>.  While I got a pretty funny look from <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/">Andrew Glover</a> at the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=47">Twin Cities Software Symposium</a> when I said I said I didn't use Eclipse, <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/community/articles/javaone/2006/nb-day.html">NetBeans Day 2006</a> made it clear that there is plenty of buzz surrounding Sun's open source IDE.  The standing room only crowd (the fire marshall was literally involved) made moving about a challenge but it was really great to that see so many people were excited about NetBeans.  While I love it, I think NetBeans has the same issue that afflicts <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/">EJB 3.0</a> - people that used it early suffered.  I've said it before - if you haven't tried NetBeans since 3.x days, you really owe it to yourself to <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">take it for a spin</a>.

The highlight for me was seeing the <a href="http://jackpot.netbeans.org/">Jackpot</a> project in action.  While we've all come to expect refactoring support in our IDEs, Jackpot takes things to a whole new level.  Since it works at the AST level, you're allowed more powerful pattern matching than you get with plain text.  Writing and sharing rules is relatively easy meaning you can quickly develop a library of powerful refactorings.  I was also very impressed by the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/products/enterprise/index.html">Enterprise Pack</a>, especially its <a href="http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/javatools/jsenterprise/tpr/learning/tutorials/uml_fe.html#roundtrip">bidirectional</a> <strong>markerless</strong> <a href="http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/javatools/jsenterprise/tpr/learning/tutorials/uml_fe.html">UML modeling</a> and I recommend taking a look at the <a href="http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/javatools/jsenterprise/tpr/reference/presentations/xmltools/xmltools.htm">XML tools</a> as well.  Of course watching them debug a mobile application that was <em>running on the cell phone</em>, was pretty impressive.

I also enjoyed having a chance to chat with NetBeans evangelist <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen">Rouman Strobl</a> (I *really* like the new glyph shirts - they were so popular that they ran out of my size at NB day.  I'm hoping some light groveling will encourage Mr. Strobl to send one my way).  I highly recommend the <a href="http://roumen.name/blog/nb_movie/netbeans_worldtour_movie.avi">NetBeans WorldTour video</a> as well - thanks for plugging <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&s=books">Foundations of Ajax</a> guys!  BTW, here's a pic from after the event:

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Andy,

I completely understand the funny look - and I don't blame you in the least.  I remember using NB back in the 3.x days and thinking it was pretty horrible (we were using it for a Sun class and we spent more time fighting the tool than actually learning the material).  Anyway, I think NetBeans has really come a long way and I'm excited to see what 6 brings to the table.  I too have quite a history with IBM tooling - also going back to the Visual Age days, however, I was ready for something new ;)  All in all, I think it's great that we have real options in this space.  Thanks for writing!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Reflections on JavaOne</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been nearly a month now since <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/">JavaOne</a> and while maybe this is a little "late" I still wanted to jot down my thoughts.  Besides I've been quiet for too long - between finishing up our <a href="http://apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10142">second book</a>, a trip to Napa, JavaOne, and the inevitable catching up required after more than a week without my laptop (I decided I really didn't want to drag this baby all the way out to California and back) time has been in short supply.  Of course it hasn't helped that we've had a darn fine stretch of weather here in the big Minne and, well, my golf course beckons.  Anyway, here are my random thoughts on my first trip to <strong>*the*</strong> Java happening.

For me, there were three key themes at JavaOne:
<ul>
<li><strong>Participate</strong>.  In every session with a Sun employee, the audience was challenged to get involved.  There were even plugs for <a href="http://jcp.org/en/participation/membership#ind">individual membership in the JCP</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Java is easy</strong> (or at least it isn't that hard).  As one would expect, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> has clearly gotten the Java community's attention and though rarely mentioned by name (at least by Sun folks) it was clear that many of the demos were designed to show Rails like qualities.</li>
<li><strong>Scripting, scripting, scripting</strong>.  <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> (see his <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/05/javaone-wrap-up.html">JavaOne wrap-up</a>) and I talked about this a couple of times but I think it's fair to call JavaOne 2006 <em>"the one about scripting."</em>  It was really quite something to see just how many sessions were devoted to languages other than Java - and frankly I think this is a <strong>very good thing</strong>.</li>
</ul>

Of course Ajax (near and dear to my heart) was <strong>*very*</strong> popular - seemed like any session that even alluded to Ajax was packed (and typically repeated).  That said, I was fairly disappointed in the Ajax talks I attended.  While I really liked <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/">Alex Russell</a>'s <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> talk, the so called Ajax framework smackdown was anything but.  Why three Sun employees were required when only two true frameworks were represented is beyond me.  I will say though, <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/javaben/">Ben Galbraith</a> was fantastic in his role as moderator; he was very funny and wasn't afraid to challenge the panelists.  Apparently the <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a> guys were invited and declined but frankly I would have appreciated at least a mention of <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a> or <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us</a>.  Oh well.

Speaking of Ajax, I would have to say (and I'm certainly <a href="http://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=92703">not</a> <a href="http://crazybob.org/2006/05/javaone-google-web-toolkit-vs-jsf.html">alone</a> in <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2006/05/javaone_2006_the_executive_sum.html">this assessment</a>) the star of the show was the Google Web Toolkit.  In my last few Ajax talks, I've bemoaned the fact that Google hadn't yet released something akin to the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo! UI Library</a> - well, looks like I can finally change my tune!  I haven't had a chance to play with it yet (seriously guys, where's the Mac version already?) but it certainly got my attention.  Whether or not GWT is at the right level of abstraction, considering it originates at Google and allows developers to write Ajax apps in Java, it will gain significant mind-share (one of my coworkers is <strong>*very*</strong> enthused).  That said, I think Russell has some great thoughts in his <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=558">JavaOne wrap up</a>.  Speaking of Alex, Sun is pretty keen on Dojo (of course <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/19767.wss">so is IBM</a>) though I'm not entirely sure why.  I'm not saying anything negative about Dojo (I think it is clearly the most ambitious toolkit in the Ajax space) I'm just curious why Sun and IBM have embraced it.  But that's a post for another day!

Let's see, what else...  Oh yeah, scripting!  I went to pretty much every session that had scripting in the title (including one BoF that *started* at 10:30 pm - I bet next year scripting makes it to general session land) which meant I stayed pretty busy.  The future of Java is less as a language and more as a platform/community; obviously Java the language isn't going anywhere (heck, COBOL will still be around in 50 years) but the alpha geeks are moving towards more dynamic languages.  Considering that, it's good to see Sun responding and I'm blown away by the shear number of initiatives regarding scripting: <a href="https://phobos.dev.java.net/">Phobos</a>, <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net/">scripting on Java.net</a>, JSRs <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223">223</a>, <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=241">241</a>, <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=274">274</a> and <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=292">292</a>.  Of course lets not forget efforts like <a href="http://jruby.sourceforge.net/">JRuby</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jython">Jython</a>.  I'm quite keen to see what the next 6-18 months brings in the Java scripting space ('bout time they listened to <a href="http://bracha.org/Site/Home.html">Gilad Bracha</a> on this point).

I really enjoyed JavaOne; it was quite an experience to say the least.  I was taken aback by the sheer size of the event - there were people everywhere and you could quite literally attend sessions from 8 am to near midnight the entire week (sleep was optional).  While I found some of the session disappointing (it was clear many presenters were there by virtue of their employers - not surprisingly, Sun and  event sponsors were well represented throughout) all in all, I really learned quite a bit.  As I expected, Josh Bloch's talks were great (if you have a chance to see him - do so); <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201310058?v=glance%26n=283155%26s=books%26v=glance">Effective Java</a> is one of my absolute favorite books (can't wait for the updated version) and Java Puzzlers was quite eye opening.  While I think some of the examples are very arcane, it certainly changes the way you think about coding which is the whole point.

I was energized by the number of people and I'd just like to say if Java is dead, there are at least 15, 000 people that didn't get the memo.  Hearing as many foreign languages as I did was fascinating (Brazilians make their presence known wherever they are...and I had a great time getting to know a couple of guys from Sweden).  Initially I was worried about the session registration process but the session checkins worked far better than I expected it to (man, why haven't those smartcards taken off?) and lines moved pretty quickly.  I'm not quite sure what to make of the <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9593_22-6072760.html">open sourcing of Java</a> (the <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=3120">how will be very interesting indeed</a>) but I couldn't help but notice the word "compatible" was prominent in the Java branding.  Despite what some people think, there's still a fair amount of innovation in the Java space and the fact that Sun is (albeit perhaps a bit late) embracing alternative languages bodes well for the future of the ecosystem.

Anyway, I had a great time and learned a bunch.  While I hope to find more ways to sneak <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby</a> and other dynamic languages into my daily life, Java will still dominate my attention for a bit yet.  While smaller events are more my style, I certainly wouldn't say no to a return trip next spring ;)]]></content:encoded>

As I mentioned in my JavaOne recap, everyone is trying to &#8220;prove&#8221; that their approach is just as easy as Rails (or they try point out how it isn&#8217;t enterprisey enough). Neal&#8217;s dead right - software wants to be complex and it takes a concentrated effort by engaged developers to do that. Let&#8217;s hope more of us are inspired by the diligence of the Rails team towards this end. [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have to admit, I'm a little late to the "<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/j2se15/">Java 5</a>" party.  My last project was stuck on WAS 5.something and we just barely got to Java 1.4 before I wandered off for greener pastures.  Of course about this time last summer I started getting a lot more interested in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&s=books">Ajax</a>, <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a> and whatnot so I just didn't pay that much attention to the newest features.

These days, my application <strong>*requires*</strong> 1.5.06 and we are highly encouraged to take advantage of the newest language features.  Now I'll admit, even when I was mired in 1.4 land, I was pretty intrigued by generics and with that in mind, I was pretty interested in <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/">Venkat Subramaniam</a>'s talk on the topic when the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff</a> tour swung into town last year.  Without a doubt, Venkat's talk was one of the highlights of the show and I was left feeling pretty good about our (admittedly pre 1.5) approach of just wrapping a collection and typing the methods we wanted to expose (this gave us some side benefits beyond type safety - we could create methods like getFooAfterDate, we could limit the API, and we could program more defensively if we needed to).

Anyway, I've been getting into quite a few debates these days about using generics where I seem to be the lone voice against (I am buoyed by <a href="http://blog.rapidred.com/">Bruce Tate</a>'s comments in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0596100949%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1150769062%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">Beyond Java</a> along with Venkat's articles: <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/articles/GenericsInJavaPartI.pdf">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/articles/GenericsInJavaPartII.pdf">part 2</a>, <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/articles/GenericsInJavaPartIII.pdf">part 3</a>).  Some of our technical leaders thing generics are the greatest thing since sliced bread and while I don't agree, I did find myself using them the other day on an interface I was creating (I know, I still feel a little...dirty).  While I'm clearly not going to change too many minds, I have to admit, running into <a href="http://jroller.com/page/murphee?entry=java_generics_faq_433_pages">Java Generics FAQ: 433 pages...</a> on <a href="http://jroller.com/page/murphee">murphee's Rant</a> (which links to <a href="http://www.angelikalanger.com/">Angelika Langer</a>'s <a href="http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.html">Java Generics FAQ</a>) really got my attention.  I mean, hey, generics are a good concept, but any implementation that inspires a FAQ of this length?  Wow, that's hard to fathom.

Now, I'll admit, I've never really liked typing the casts but I'm not so sure that <code>List&lt;Type> myList = new ArrayList&lt;Type>()</code> is a huge step forward (and just read a bit about type erasure).  Hey, I'm all for better code but I've just got to ask - when was the last time you got a class cast exception in your production code?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll be the first to admit, I don't travel all that much.  Sure, I've been to Greece and Spain but those were big occasion kind of trips - I don't really travel for work.  Today I took what is normally a short, trivial hop from good old <a href="http://www.mspairport.com/msp/">MSP</a> to <a href="http://www.chicago-ord.com/">ORD</a>.  Heck, the Twin Cities is so close to Chicago, you could practically fly down for lunch!  But of course that wasn't about to happen tonight...oh no.

As I suspect a few of you know the <a href="http://railsconf.org/pages/hotel">Wyndham Oâ€™Hare</a> is host to the first annual <a href="http://railsconf.org/">RailsConf</a> (and if the ride over from the airport is any indication - we've got some serious alpha geeks in the hizzie).  Ordinarily, I would expect to make the hop in about 45 minutes or an hour but you see, we had some "weather" in the midwest today and apparently O'Hare "fell behind" a bit.  We were delayed leaving the big Minnie - well, we pushed off from the gate just a few minutes late but of course we had to take a tour of the airport (seriously, who in their right mind thinks of departure time as when the doors are shut?)  Basically, we were nearly 45 minutes late just getting in the air.

Of course the delay gave us some time to play the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a> game that is carryon bags and the overhead bins.  Maybe we're just too nice here in flyover land but when I left San Francisco, they were checking bag size pretty carefully - if it didn't fit in the box, it was getting checked.  Clearly, whomever is responsible for that in our neck of the woods has Wednesdays off because some of the bags people tried to smuggle on board would comfortably fit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup">Stanley Cup</a>.

This being a short flight, most people didn't want to check their bags further exacerbating the situation.  The <strong>*packed*</strong> flight combined with bags that really should have been checked (seriously, if you can't put the bag in perpendicular to the bin and still shut the door, it's just too big) meant we had a few crabby campers on board (I thought one guy was going to throw some punches - he was <strong>*not*</strong> happy that his sacred bag was being checked.  Never mind that it was too big to fit in the bin...).  Eventually we were in the air and after failing at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sudoko</a> (man, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Shortz">Will Shortz</a> must just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blow_(film)">weigh his cash</a> - I swear every third person was working through one of his books), I was pleased when the pilot said he was beginning his decent into O'Hare.

I'll have to ask Ryan for clarification, but I think this is pilot code for "we'll be in the air for another 45 minutes" because shortly after giving us all some false hope, he reported (from the flight-deck) that we were in a holding pattern waiting for ORD to "catch up" with their backlog.  Sigh.  I got really excited when he told the flight crew to prepare for landing - which again, must be code for "don't tell the chattel, err passengers, but we've got another 30 minutes".  Eventually we did land - more than an hour late, after being locked in a tin can for more than 2 hours (man, another hour or so and I could have been in California) we were on the ground in the windy city, happy days, the ordeal was over!

Ahh, but there was a catch.  You see, apparently O'Hare only has one or two jet-ways (it's not that big an airport I guess) and, well, we pulled up to a gate that didn't have one so we were just going to have to sit and wait until the ground crew "got around" to bringing one over (perhaps from Midway).  Amazingly, this only took about 10 minutes but by now, I was convinced that driving would have not only been faster, but much less stressful (though it would have cost more when you factor in parking and gas).  We were finally able to deplane (wow, according to my spell checker, that's really a word) and amazingly our luggage wasn't lost (don't laugh, it's happened to me...on a trip to Chicago).  Of course it took us a while to find the magic "door number one" where our shuttle would whisk us away to the hotel.  As you would expect, we just missed the van so it was the full 15-20 minutes watching anxiously (we looked like puppies and kittens at the shelter) as van after van drove by.  I guess a mess of huddled geeks just isn't as irresistible as a small ball of fur...

Of course we did finally get the hotel - more than five hours after starting our journey (any longer and I would have thought I was in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey">Greek tragedy</a>); while I don't think I would have actually driven down, flying didn't save me that much.  Oh well, I'm here and I'm pumped about RailsConf!  I'll do my best to blog along (and unlike <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/10/reflections-on-javaone/">JavaOne</a>, I'm wired up - it only took me 20 minutes, and Safari, to get my complimentary wifi hookup.  But hey, I've got an <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/Product/0,,a10-c440-p8,00.html">Aeron</a> so whose complaining?)  All right, I'm crawling into bed...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[And so it begins!  I've had the pleasure of seeing <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> in the past and as I expected he's on top of his game today.  Funny and articulate, I think I'd sit and listen to Dave explain actuary tables, discuss a hot new time share investment, heck, even just read the phone book.  I've never heard <a href="http://clarkware.com/">Mike Clark</a> live but he's top notch!  The only complaint I can make at this point - the ~100 or so of us are overwhelming this little wireless network.  Apparently an "industrial grade" installation is coming this afternoon (thank god - otherwise this could get ugly).

The morning section has largely been a <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby</a> overview - a level set as they say.  While I've read through <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html">Pick Axe</a>, it never hurts to hear another twist on the material (especially blocks and symbols).  So far I've taken a ton of notes and I'm (surprise) even more interested in finding new ways to "sneak" Ruby into my daily work.

The section on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming_(programming)">meta programming</a> was particularly interesting.  The beauty of <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> is, to a large degree, thanks to the amazing capabilities of the Ruby language itself - all calls have receivers (though you can warp your mind a bit when it comes to class of Class...), definitions are active (the code can change on the fly) and classes are open (so you're always free to add or modify methods on <strong>*any*</strong> class).  I'll admit, as a recovering Java addict, my first thought when I encounter open classes is not a positive one.  While the thought of the proverbial chim chim adding to (or changing) one of <strong>*my*</strong> classes makes my skin crawl, in the hands of competent developers it's a darn powerful feature.  Luckily Dave shared an inside tip on how to fix the situation where a lesser mortal mucks up a class they shouldn't (lets just say it involves a trip to Home Depot)...  Still, the whole meta programming concept really appeals to me - I want that power!  Of course it means we have a greater level of responsibility but then we are professionals right?  Heck, carpenters don't use "safety saws" to build a house, why do developers deliberately hamstring themselves?

Frankly, I think this is a numbers game.  The average Java application requires significantly more developers than the average Rails app so the chances that you'll have a couple of, shall we say, less than excellent developers is much higher in the Java space.  So, if you're one of the silver backs, you <em>want</em> your language to make it harder for the feces hurler one cube over to, well, screw things up too badly.  Personally, I think I'll take the more expressive power over the safety...

Lunch was a blast!  We (Ben from Minnie, Gary from California, John from DC but thinking of moving to Minnie!) wandered over to <a href="http://www.chipotle.com/">Chipotle</a> (mmm, burritos) where we engaged in a far ranging conversation on billable rates, why Ruby and Rails rocks, thoughts on <a href="http://an-inconvenient-truth.com/">An Inconvenient Truth</a>, whether the greater level of transparency afforded by the blogosphere has contributed to the level of cynicism in modern politics...for a while there I thought I was at a model UN meeting or something.  It was good times!

The afternoon was Rails in a blur - basically, Mike and Dave wanted to introduce us to the key concepts, places to avoid, and topics we should perhaps focus on over the course of the long weekend.  Of course they did the standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_view_controller">MVC</a> lecturelet but they had an interesting twist: think of the controller as the CEO, involved in strategy but not the details - which are carried out by the admins (in other words the model) while the outside view is handled by marketing (the view component).  Good analogy!

There was a very interesting conversation about code in the view and whether or not web designers can "handle" that.  Mike was pretty adamant that most web designers were more than capable saying that while we as server side guys dabble in web stuff, the view folks want to dip their toes into our waters as well.  In other words, don't sell the front end guys short - they're probably sharper than you think ;)  Again Dave had sage advice for dealing with designers that can't stand a little code - get rid of them.

The advice from the scaffolding section was pretty spot on too.  While great for showing off and exploring, as of now, it's just not up to par for production code.  But don't forget, when you use scaffolding to build a structure, eventually the scaffolding comes down...  After learning where not to go (components, engines, XML-RPC/SOAP), Dave and Mike pounded through a number of topics including testing, routes (however you pronounce it), REST, <a href="http://plugins.radrails.org/directory/show/69">Simply Restful</a>, plugins, and <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17">deployment</a>.

All in all, a great session (participants raised over $8,000 for charities) and I'm even more interested in attending a <a href="http://www.pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic Studio</a>  session (not sure which one though...)  One interesting note - sure am seeing a large number of Macs (shocker) as I wander around!  And my wife made this comment when I got back to the room "there sure are an awful lot of geeks here".  Yes dear, there really are!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Clearly I got up too late this morning - by the time I got down for breakfast, the ballroom was <strong>*packed*</strong>: to the point where there weren't three seats at a single table for the other Minnesota lads I hooked up with!  After some intro material from the <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby Central</a> gang, <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> presented his keynote where he challenged the community to:

<ul>
	<li>Improve data integration
</li>
	<li>Come up with a better solution to real world CRUD
</li>
	<li>Fix deployment
</li>
</ul>

Frankly, Rails has to answer a few key questions if it wants to grow beyond the alpha geek stage - of course whether the community ever wants to be mainstream is a very good question.  Dave challenged the attendees to meet the proverbial "average Java programmer" half way - otherwise, Rails will just remain a niche.  Obviously Rails will continue to mature (heck, someday it might even be <em>enterprise</em>) and I think a lot of the things that Dave talked about will get fixed (probably soon).  But the community is going to have to do it - the core team only has so much time.  The message I took away is oddly similar to the mantra at <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/10/reflections-on-javaone/">JavaOne</a> - participate, participate, participate.

My first session of the day was <a href="http://clarkware.com/">Mike Clark</a> on <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17">Capistrano</a> (apparently <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/">Jamis Buck</a> had a passport issue so Mike pitch hit).  Having only just toyed around with apps on my machine and having read other people's accounts of deployment heck, I left thinking Capistrno is pretty much the cat's meow.  And it isn't just for Rails dangit!  Pretty much anytime you need to move some files around, cap can help.  Obviously we didn't get too deep into deployment (heck the Prag guys have a <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/deploy/index.html">whole seminar</a> devoted to) but it sure seems like it's one of the rough spots that needs buffing (luckily there is a lot of energy in that space so I expect it'll only get better - but <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Tech/Ruby/MikesCapistranoTalk.html">don't just take my word for it</a>).

I choose poorly on my second talk; it was pretty disappointing.  While there were a few nuggets in there about discovering what users need vs. want, I was really left wondering how this applied in any way, shape, or form to Rails - I mean seriously, how did that abstract get past the organizers?  OK, so it wasn't really that bad but had the room not been packed to point where the fire marshal would have disapproved, I just stuck it out.  Luckily, the rest of the day more than made up one little blip.

As a certified "enterprise" developer, I've never really had to deal with authentication issues (there was always a group for that) so I figured I better take a look at the session on identity and rails.  Kiran Dandekar of VeriSign gave a fantastic overview of identity (reminiscent of Dick Hardt's <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">Identity 2.0</a> talk at OSCON 2005).  Kiran and Mike (I think!) talked quite a bit about their <a href="http://pip.verisignlabs.com/">Personal Identity Provider</a> (based on <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>).  Considering what it allowed you to do (imagine never creating another login again - and selectively choosing what information was given to each site) I am very interested in pursuing this for my login needs.  <strong>VERY</strong> cool stuff.

Next up was a session from Amy "<a href="http://slash7.com/">slash7.com</a>" Hoy on how to overcoming scaffolding addiction.  While Dave argued for better scaffolding, Amy was advocating running in the opposite direction.  Her talk walked us through the basics in an effort to prove we don't really need the generated code.  Sure, it might look cool, but at the end of the day, the only way to learn is to jump in.

The evening was jam packed - keynotes from none other than <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> plus a command performance from <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">Why the Lucky Stiff</a>.  Fowler's talk was fantastic!  He talked about the drive towards simplicity and the significant influence that Rails has had on software (something that was quite evident at JavaOne).  He also said something that really stuck for me: <em>quick doesn't have to be dirty</em>.  Languages like Ruby, frameworks like Rails allow us to be quick and clean, something that is very powerful.

He also talked about the need for a conversational relationship with customers instead of one where we simple write down a stream of "this is what I want".  He emphasized the need for rapid feedback allowing us to converge on a solution based on mutual exploration.  He quoted the tracer bullets method from <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">Prag Programmer</a> emphasizing that if the bullets are cheap enough, fire-aim, fire-aim, fire-aim is a heck of a lot more efficient than aim-aim-aim-aim-aim-aim-aim-fire!  Of course rapid feedback is also likely to mean a more engaged customer which naturally leads to a better solution.

After talking about what happens when we are freed from worrying about plumbing code (we can focus on solving actual business problems) he talked about <a href="http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/41/6/363">post modern software development</a>.  Basically, the idea is that rather than creating these perfect (modern) structures where everything is the same, we essentially just hack things together.  Take UNIX - it's one of the stablest operating systems out there and it is mostly just a hodgepodge glued together...but it works!  Funny, isn't that the story in nature?  He challenged us to change the way we think and to focus on gluing scraps together, to just deal with the complexity and the inconsistencies.  His parting words really rang true though - at the end of the day, it's about the community.  We're what matters, we're what make a difference.

After grabbing a bite to eat, I was very excited to hear Paul Graham live.  I've read plenty of his stuff and listened to the odd pod cast here and there but I'll admit, I bought my ticket based largely on the keynotes (how can you go wrong with this crew?)  As expected, Paul did not disappoint (he was hilarious!) and I can't wait to read the online version of his talk...  Of course there were lots of memorable lines (I'm working on a quote post for later) but his main point was "look to the margins."  He preached the values of being an outsider discussing the freedom that comes with being small and obscure.  Successful companies are often victims of their very success - they can't cannibalize themselves.  They often overlook certain opportunities because they lack prestige or aren't large enough (or enterprise enough!)  If you're not sure what to do, Paul advised that you just make something.  Seriously, after listening to this guy, a startup just sounds like a good idea!

OK, at this point, I'm twelve hours into a day devoted to a technology I don't even get to use in anger (I'm amazed at just how many people are making money on this stuff) but we're not done yet!  Oh no, it's time for Why to regal us with his music and humor.  You know, I've heard the buzz before and I think I even listened to a podcast from SxSW or something but I've got to tell you, if you haven't heard him live...well, something is clearly lost in translation.  Maybe Paul was just a great warmup act (I mean no disrespect), but Why was ridiculously funny!  The whole <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=koala+bear&hl=en&lr=&sa=X&oi=images&ct=title">Koala bear</a> thing was great but the, ahh, interesting Ruby hacks were right up there too.  I'm sure I only caught half the jokes but let me say - if you ever get a chance to see Why live, do <strong>*not*</strong> miss it.

Well, that's enough for now - my wife is already snoring and tomorrow is another long day!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I think more than a few folks spent much of last night in or around the bar because this morning it was quite a bit quieter at breakfast (let's just say most folks wandered in closer to 9).  As you might expect at a conference with 500 or so developers (nearly everyone with a laptop) the wi fi is, at best, spotty, still it's quite something to see a bushel full of Macs at every table!  Seriously, there can't be more than 10-20 Windows boxes running around and from what I've seen a fair portion of those are actually running some flavor of Linux.  Anyway, I started me day listening to <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie">Obie Fernandez</a> of <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/index.html">ThoughtWorks</a> talk about the projects he's been involved with over the last year or so.  Clearly there is a lot of interest in Ruby and Rails at ThoughtWorks and considering how "enterprisey" they are, that bodes well for wider adoption of this "niche" technology.

While there were lots of details he couldn't reveal, it was quite something to see just how many projects they've done (and the variety, from standard web apps to touch screen kiosks) - and more importantly, how interested customers (big customers at that) are in Rails.  Regarding the "data center issue" (i.e., the excuse that we can't use Rails because it's not supported) Obie relayed a story where, when finally asked, the manager at the data center didn't have any problem letting them do what they needed to do.  This is the first time I've ever seen Obie live - but I get the feeling he had a long night ;) he seemed a tad tuckered, perhaps even a bit hung over, I'm not sure.  All in all, it was very encouraging to hear his experiences - if ThoughtWorks is doing this much work in the space, I suspect they'll have some influence on those that still think Rails isn't ready for the enterprise.

The next two talks I hit were on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Specific_Language">DSL</a>s/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming_(programming)">metaprogramming</a>.  One of the things I find so interesting about Ruby is the ease with which you can create a DSL thanks to open classes and the "missing method" hook.  The first talk was by Steven Hammond and he discussed his experience building a DSL for a game he's working on.  Steven focussed more on the background material - what a DSL is, when you need one and what the pitfalls are.  

While Steven's talk was more focussed on more philosophical issues Brian Katz did a deep dive on an authorization/identity DSL that he put together for one of his projects.  I have to admit, much of his talk was above my Ruby-fu (and I don't think I was alone based on some of the chuckles from the audience when he asked the audience if we understood some less than trivial Ruby) but I still found it pretty useful.  He answered lots of questions about why he made certain decisions and he also explored the "meta-classes" which was pretty helpful.  While I've understood the concept ever since reading about <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html">language workbenches</a>, it was always pretty nebulous how'd you actually create one.  I might not be ready to actually sit down and write my own DSL, but I feel like I know where to start!

The argument I hear over and over regarding Rails is that it isn't "enterprisey" enough.  While not nearly as widespread as Java or .Net, Rails is indeed being used to power something more than "yet another social tagging site" and that's what Rick Bradely and Charles Johnson of <a href="http://www.centerstone.org/">Centerstone</a> discussed in their talk on Rails and the Enterprise.  Centerstone started out writing the prototypical Java EE application using JBoss, Hibernate et al but after getting started they quickly moved to Rails where they saw a significant decrease in the amount of code they produced (on the order of less code than the XML in their Java EE approach...)  You might recognize this from Rick's blog <a href="http://rewrite.rickbradley.com/">Following the Rewrite</a> - while I wish he and his team were writing a tad more, it's still a great example of yet another <em>enterprise</em> application that is being written in Rails.

Rick relayed a quote from his CIO which basically was: "A year ago, no one knew what Rails was, now they say no one uses Rails."  How many more applications have to be built before people realize how wrong that last line is?  Obviously, there is a class of application for which Rails is clearly the wrong answer - but the variety of solutions that can be built with Rails is much larger than many enterprisey folks want to believe.  But hey, as <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> said <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/23/railsconf-day-1/">yesterday</a>, the value is in the margins so maybe I should just look at this as a huge opportunity.

Dealing directly with web/app servers is relatively new to me - at least as done in the Rails world.  While I've worked with <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>, <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>, WAS, etc, I've never dealt directly with configuring them.  Considering how key things like <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">lighty</a> and <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/">FCGI</a> are to a Rails app, I figured I better attend at least <em>one</em> session on the topic hence why I went to <a href="http://jan.kneschke.de/">Jan Kneschke</a>'s Accelerating Rails with Lighty.  All I have to say is I have a <strong>*ton*</strong> to learn in this space and frankly I think it's one of the things that the Rails world needs to overcome.  At the end of the day, I'm a developer - I don't want to have to deal (much) with issues like what mod I need to install and which app server works best with which web server.  I think it's interesting that for a framework that "just works" and is so opinionated, the deployment issues are the real hang-up.  I'm not sure whether most Rails developers <strong>*should*</strong> concern themselves so deeply with the inner workings of lighty or FCGI.  Again, some things were a tad over my head but there was a lot of material in this talk - enough that Jan went about 20 minutes over his scheduled time (no real sense of urgency in his talk...even when he knew he was running long, he didn't really speed up his cadence).

Next up the indefatigable <a href="http://clarkware.com/">Mike Clark</a> on testing!  When you see how freaking easy Rails makes testing...well, it makes me want to cry actually.  The functional and integration tests are fantastic, especially with the new named routes feature but the support for fixtures makes unit testing a snap too.  I've written Java systems with thousands of tests but there were lots of areas we just couldn't get to - with Rails, we wouldn't have the normal excuses.  Mike walked us through the essentials including why we as developers should care about testing, the basic asserts in <a href="http://testunit.talbott.ws/">Test::Unit</a>, what Rails adds to the mix, and how straightforward integration tests actually are.

When you first look at a Rails app, one thing you might notice is the gentle reminders (or is that just good old fashioned midwestern guilt?) about the importance of testing.  After all, you've got directories that are just sitting there begging to be populated!  Testing is just part of the culture, part of the community.  Rails itself has a slew of tests, running <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">rake</a> causes all the tests to run and <code>rake stats</code> lets you know how much test code you've written.  It doesn't hurt that Ruby and Rails makes testing so much easier than it is in other languages; creating a little testing DSL is a snap thanks to Ruby.  Want to <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/FrontPage.html">mock</a> out a class?  No problem - just put a class of the same name in your mocks directory and stub out whatever method you want!  We use mocking libraries on my projects, but they aren't even close to that easy.

I think the emphasis on testing speaks highly of the Rails/Ruby community.  After three days here (and I'll admit, this is a pretty self selecting group) I can't help but think there are a lot of really top notch professionals in this space - people that feel a responsibility to produce good, working code.  I'm not saying these types don't exist in Java or .Net, but it just seems to be part of the DNA of these individuals.  I'm not sure what the cause and effect is here (are more adept developers just drawn to this or does Ruby/Rails just make it so natural?) but it really is something.  I have to say, I wish my Java apps were this easy to test...  Honestly, you would think the test infected nature of Rails would make it an easier sell at the enterprise level.

The last talk of the day was by <a href="http://blog.talbott.ws/">Nathaniel Talbott</a> (what a great first name!), creator of the aforementioned Test::Unit.  Nathaniel spoke on Homesteading; basically, he was challenging us to do what we love, to "buy the ticket" and get out there and build something.  We've got so many opportunities available to us, so many ways to create our own little businesses - we just have to execute.  We are all at risk, whether we realize it or not, however we have to assess that risk and expose our assumptions.  Anyway, there were so many great thoughts in his talk that I don't think I can do it justice in this post but let's just say between listening to him and Paul Graham, I'm really tempted to take the proverbial plunge.  Nathaniel's talk really was a call to action and I'm interested to see how many people take him up on that.

After dinner, we were regaled by the creator himself, <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">DHH</a>.  David's talk was more tutorial than inspirational but it was quite interesting to see where he is taking Rails.  I can see where the arrogant label comes from but it's also clear he has a real passion about software - and many of this opinions are rooted in sound thinking.  A key theme was using the HTTP verbs to indicate the action on a controller instead of imbedding it in the URL.  He also spent a great deal of time talking about intersection entities between many to many associations and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">RESTful</a> web services.  All in all, a pretty interesting talk - and I'm sure others will do it more justice than me!]]></content:encoded>

Can it be any different? I mean we can&#8217;t possibly do quick and clean could we? Well, Obie Fernandez thinks there&#8217;s a way: Ruby and its close personal friend Rails. In a recent post about enterprise adoption (essentially expanding on his talk at RailsConf) Obie offers some great advice on how to pitch Rails to the enterprise. He hits it on the head when he says: The biggest challenge, in my opinion, is that lots of teams doing J2EE have people are used to thinking that quick == dirty. Martin&#8217;s keynote had tons of good information for anyone wanting to evangelize Ruby as enabling quick and clean solutions, and well-written Rails applications are all about quick and clean.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my experience with conferences, the last day things start to get a little more sane.  People slow down - they're usually exhausted from several hours of drinking from the firehouse (of course some of that ain't just <em>learning water</em> either...) and at least a few people have already travelled home (wi fi is almost usable!) so the numbers start to drop.  Today is no different - I didn't need to arrive at my first session 20 minutes early just to get a decent seat, in fact, after a great chat with <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/index.html">ThoughtWorker</a> <a href="http://blog.objo.com/">Joe O'Brien</a> (thanks for the tip on the backpack and the girls are adorable!) I was able to saunter up to the front of the room about a minute to 9.

My first session was on open source testing tools in Rails by Dave Hoover.  Dave covered <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/wtr/">Watir</a> and <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> with a shout out to <a href="http://sahi.sourceforge.net/">Sahi</a>.  Over the years, I've tried various UI level testing tools and have always been left disappointed.  Most are just too brittle - change something innocuous like today's date and all of a sudden you have failing tests all over the place.  Many used proprietary scripting languages further raising the barrier of entry but worse, you typically had to plunk down some serious change on licenses.  Lucklily, the open source world is coming to the rescue and while both of the tools Dave demoed have their issues (Watir is basically Windows only and Selenium has an odd syntax) it's certainly good that we have options.

I've read a bit of what <a href="http://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley</a> has said about identity but I've never really worried too much about it - after all, I've spent so much of my time developing corporate solutions where it was handled by others.  Sure, I've been annoyed at the volume of logins I need and it concerns me how much of that data is spread all around the web but after seeing Matt Pelletier of <a href="http://www.eastmedia.com/">Eastmedia</a> talk about <a href="http://openid.net/">Open ID</a> (in a talk related to one I attended on <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/23/railsconf-day-1/">Friday</a>) it sure makes me want to explore that solution.  While there are still issues to be worked out (and features to add such as reputation services and attribute verification) it feels like there is a lot of promise in this space.  Based on the questions the audience asked, people have clearly thought through some of the ramifications of identity and privacy (more so than many large companies apparently).

If you're read any of my other posts on RailsConf (<a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/23/railsconf-day-1/">day 1</a> and <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/24/railsconf-day-2/">day 2</a>) you may sense a theme: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming_(programming)">metaprogramming</a>.  I'm really interested in this topic (partially due to my upcoming teaching assignment...more on that later) so I had to attend <a href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/">Stuart Halloway</a>'s talk (besides, I knew what a great speaker he is so I probably would have gone to anything by him).  Stu went through a number of tricks in Ruby such as to_proc, indifferent access, and whiny nil.  One thing I've really noticed about the Ruby/Rails community - they get the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>, they really understand that 80%, that good enough, is well, good enough.  I'm not sure what it is, but on so many of the Java projects I've worked on, we've really gotten bogged down worrying about that edge case, that thing that happens once in a while, we seem to focus too much on the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2005/12/21/what-if/">what if</a>.  For whatever reason, that doesn't seem to be a problem in Rails land.  While certainly some of that is language related (Java forces you to work in certain ways) but a lot of that is just attitudinal.

After showing of some cool Ruby-fu, Stu went on to describe how certain things are done in Rails including class reloading, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/api/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord</a> accessor generation, transactions, and (my personal favorite) how data gets from the controllers to the views.  If I count up all the time I've spent pushing data into and out of forms on a web page...and the pain that has caused (hmm, is that int value <em>really</em> 0 or has it just not been entered yet?) it makes me want to cry.  Rails makes so much of this cruft just go away and I love that!  A great talk by a fantastic speaker.

After lunch mister <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>/<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant</a> himself, the chief photographer for all things <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>, <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/">James Duncan Davidson</a> did a talk on deploying Rails apps (I've never seen James live before - he has quite an interesting background!)  As I mentioned in an earlier post, I'm actually quite surprised at how <strong>*hard*</strong> deploying Rails apps can be.  <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave</a> challenged the community on Friday to fix it and I expect things will quickly improve, but for such opinionated software, for a framework that makes so many things so darn easy, deployment is really a weak link.  James gave some good tips (of course every app is different so it's hard to arrive at "this is what will work for you" type advice) and also pointed out some of the real land mines out there.  With the brain power in this space, I know the problem will improve, it's just a matter of when.

The event wrapped up with Q and A of the Rails core team (well, 3/4 of it anyway).  Most of the questions were actually fairly technical in nature but the 80% answer came out on more than one occasion.  I think the adherence to this mantra is the core strength of Rails - I really wish <em>*that*</em> would infect other languages and frameworks.

Anyway, I'm quite tired - been some long days here but tonight my wife and I will venture out for some classic Chicago pizza!  All in all, I have to say I had a great weekend and I'm even more jazzed to further my work with Rails.  I have mixed feelings about the news that next year the event will be cosponsored with O'Reilly,  I suspect they will allow thousands in and probably triple the price and of course the event is moved to the West coast (Portland to be exact.)  While I would like to go, we'll see...  Other than the spotty wi fi (which is now, btw, extremely snappy), the hotel was fine (well, my wife would have preferred for the pool to be open) and the dining options near by were, ahh, limited (surprisingly, the constant airplanes - like every 1-2 minutes - wasn't too distracting).  Still, it was great to meet some new people (though I understand where the cult label comes from), folks that have really been inspirational.  Thanks to everyone that made this event all that it was!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While I was in Chicago, Ryan and I did a podcast with the lads from <a href="http://www.zerologik.com/">ZeroLogik</a>.  We had a fantastic time chatting about a <strong>*wide*</strong> variety of topics (seriously Shane if you ever find yourself in need of another voice, just let me know).  I want to thank Shane and the rest of the lads for all their patience - we've been trying to get together with them for a while now.  One night we mixed up the time shift, another night Ryan didn't have power and we were supposed to talk last Wednesday but the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/21/flying/">travel gods conspired against me</a>.  Anyway, we finally got everyone online at the same time last Thursday <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/22/rails-guidebook/">after the guidebook</a> and all is well!

I haven't had a chance to listen all the way through but I have to say the hotel wi-fi was a little, well, spotty so on more than a few occasions I wasn't always sure what had been said - or even if my words got through (though that really doesn't sound like me)!  I'll warn you right now, ZeroLogik carries the explicit tag in iTunes...  Here's a link to <a href="http://www.zerologik.com/2006/06/zerologik_026_06222006.php">their blog</a> and the <a href="http://zerologik.com/episodes/ZeroLogik_Episode_26_20060622.mp3">mp3</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Who Should Run Software Companies?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple of weeks back, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a> posted <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/06/16.html">My First BillG Review</a> which was mostly about the time Bill Gates reviewed his spec for the Basic programming language.  While a very interesting read, there were a few quotes I just had to call out.  Love 'em or hate 'em, Microsoft has been very successful (sometimes employing questionable practices) and Gates is a key aspect of that - he's a darn smart customer.

Joel has a couple of quotes that I just had to call out:

<blockquote>
Watching non-programmers trying to run software companies is like watching someone who doesn't know how to surf trying to surf.</blockquote>

Amen.  I have to admit, I find it very odd when manager types expose this belief that "management is management" - we don't have to "get it" to sell it.  Frankly, I don't buy that, I think even at the c-level, these guys need to have a pretty darn good understanding of the limits of the products and technologies they sell.  They don't have to be able to program it, but they <strong>*must*</strong> understand what <em>can</em> be done and where the edge cases are.  It's pretty scary what happens when a technology company is run by an organization other than the one that produces it.

The next paragraph is just pure gold though:

<blockquote>"It's ok! I have great advisors standing on the shore telling me what to do!" they say, and then fall off the board, again and again. The standard cry of the MBA who believes that management is a generic function. Is Ballmer going to be another John Sculley, who nearly drove Apple into extinction because the board of directors thought that selling Pepsi was good preparation for running a computer company? The cult of the MBA likes to believe that you can run organizations that do things that you don't understand.</blockquote>

Software isn't the same as adult snack foods.  In MBA-land, all the good little students were told it doesn't matter what the peons do, as long as you have a degree from our school you'll be able to run <strong>*any*</strong> company, no matter what it does.  Sorry, software is just a different beast and you best understand what you're getting into.  Anyway - as usual, a great read!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ryan and I had a rather interesting package waiting for us yesterday - a translated copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&s=books">Foundations of Ajax</a> (I think Korean, but we're not really sure).  I dig the new cover and I've got to say, it's pretty cool to see our book in a different language!

Here are a couple of pix:

<img src="/images/foa_trans_front.png" alt="Foundations Translation Front Cover" />

<img src="/images/foa_trans_back.png" alt="Foundations Translation Back Cover" />

There's also a new <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/articles/foundations-of-ajax/">review</a> on Javalobby.  I would like to say that at least a few of the examples run without a Servlet container ;)  and given this particular site's audience, I'm betting people will be just fine.  We certainly could have delved into patterns a bit more and I would direct people to Christian Gross' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1590596161%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1151631732%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8">Ajax Patterns and Best Practices</a> and  <a href="http://softwareas.com/">Michael Mahemoff</a>'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0596101805%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fqid%3D1151631861%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_2%3Fie%3DUTF8">Ajax Design Patterns</a> (also check out his excellent <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/">Ajax Patterns</a> web site).

All in all, a pretty positive review.  As I've mentioned before, given more time, we would have written some examples in some other server side languages.  I was happy to hear that the book has helped the reviewer (Schalk Neethling) and thanks for noticing the tools chapters - lots of people seem to miss those somehow!

By the way, that <strong>*was*</strong> Ryan on <a href="http://www.publicradio.org/columns/futuretense/">Future Tense</a> a while back <a href="http://www.publicradio.org/tools/media/player/news/futuretense/daily/2006/06/21">talking</a> about Ajax...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[is doing his own thing.  A few months back, <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a> blogged about the books that are on her "<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/02/whats_on_your_v.html">virtual coffee table</a>".  Maybe this is obvious, but I'm an absolute sucker for books - in grade school, we'd order books from these little catalogs (I'm sure it was a fundraiser of some sort) and inevitably my parents would spring for more than a couple.  I have very found memories of "delivery day", walking up to the front of the room and taking my bushel of books back to my desk.  A couple of times I weaseled out of the annual holiday play just so I could read during the practice sessions and if you've ever seen my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F">Amazon</a> account or, well, walked through my house, you'd know I've still got a thing for books!

I'm also a fan of lists like <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a>'s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FogCreekMBACurriculum.html">management training program</a> or <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a>'s <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/04/my_ten_favorite.html">ten favorite books</a> (and you can see what <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/recent-reads/">I've been reading</a>...though it's a bit out of date and of course my proverbial <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/my-bookshelf/">book shelf</a>).  Anywho, the other night I looked over at my coffee table and saw this rather interesting collection of books (sorry it's a little blurry).

<img src="/images/odd_books.png" alt="Books on my coffee table." />

Ironically, I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0596100949%2Fqid%3D1151720737%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Beyond Java</a> at <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/10/reflections-on-javaone/">JavaOne</a> and, well, I think you'll see a trend here (as evidenced by <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/category/railsconf/">these entries</a> from RailsConf).  Can you tell which book stands out?  I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F032133678X%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1151720703%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8">Java Puzzlers</a> because I'm pretty sure anything by Bloch is worth reading (I cannot wait for the next edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201310058?v=glance%26n=283155%26s=books%26v=glance">Effective Java</a>) and, well, his <a href="http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/2006/coreplatform/TS-1188.html">talk at JavaOne</a> was darn interesting.  Anyway, I'm heavily influenced by guys like <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a>, <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/">Andy Hunt</a>, <a href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/">Justin Gehtland, Stuart Halloway</a>, <a href="http://clarkware.com/">Mike Clark</a> and several others (hmm, common theme - <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">NFJS</a>!) and given their propensity towards things other than Java I'm listening.  That's <strong>*not*</strong> to say I have anything against Java nor do I think Java is going away, in fact it bodes well that Sun is pushing hard into the <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net/">dynamic language world</a> (take a loot at <a href="https://phobos.dev.java.net/">Phobos</a>).  BTW, the other two books (as if you needed me to tell you) are <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> and <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_eir/index.html">Enterprise Integration with Ruby</a>.

Just as a golfer uses more than one club to play 18 holes, I think a competent developer should know more than one programming language.  Saying that I'm spending most of my spare time looking into alternatives to Java is simply a way for me to expand my mind.  I was a tad irritated by all the Java bashing last weekend but there is an awful lot the Java camp can learn from the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> guys (and vice versa I should add).  I don't know where Ruby or Rails breaks down yet, but I'm pretty darn interested in finding out...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I must be on a bit of an <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/">Andy Hunt</a> jag <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/02/software-engineering/">here</a>...  A couple of weeks ago he posted <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog/articles/2006/06/19/change-aint-all-its-cracked-up-to-be">this link</a> to <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/fullcolumn/column-20060615-01.html">Only the Adaptable Will Survive Change</a>.  In some organizations, change is like the proverbial third rail - touch it and someone is going to get hurt.  Some people think change somehow invalidates what was done before but that's just not true; making adjustments is a healthy activity.  Anyway, there are a few great quotes from the article that I'd like to call out:



<blockquote>developing software is such a complex activity, anything substantive that you leave until later wonâ€™t happen, wonâ€™t happen well, or will grow worse and fester until it becomes unmanageable. A certain kind of friction increases, and things get harder to fix and harder to change. As with any friction, the only way to fight it effectively is to continually inject a little energy into the system.
</blockquote>


How many projects have started with the ideal of testing only to have management say "we don't have time" shortly after the project gets underway?  Or my favorite "just hack that change in, we'll go back and clean it up after that important demo."  Yeah right.  Technical debt accumulates - you either pay it off over time or eventually you are forced to refinance.  It's very tempting to just let it ride, especially if things seem to be working well, but eventually you're going to have to send a check to the bank (and the dollar amount only gets larger).  We can't let the enormity of the problems intimidate us either, a little bit each day and we'll get to where we need to be.  If we focus on the size of the problem instead of just doing something we'll never accomplish anything.  Agile methods fundamentally get this idea.  Tests are written everyday, code is refactored everyday, customers are shaping the product everyday.  To use an analogy, it's a heck of a lot easier to maintain a healthy weight than it is to lose 30 pounds.

Tempting as it may be for some, it's important to realize that agile isn't the same as crisis management.  


<blockquote>Crisis management occurs when problems are left to fester until they become so large that you have to drop everything else youâ€™re doing to respond to the crisis immediately. This causes secondary crises, so now you have a vicious cycle of never-ending crisis and panic. Thatâ€™s precisely what you want to avoid by adopting an agile approach.</blockquote>


I've been in "fire fighting" style organizations and it really isn't much fun.  You never get a chance to act strategically, you're forced into tactical solutions.  The pressure to just "get any fix in" causes the code to deteriorate meaning the next change will be even harder than it has to be.  Quick and dirty becomes the mantra and while some congratulate themselves on being responsive, most everyone realizes there is a price to be paid for that speed.

Change isn't limited to code though - everything we do needs to evolve as well.


<blockquote>Agile development recognizes the importance of pragmatism, and seeks to adjust everythingâ€”the schedule, the design, the featuresâ€”based on what is really happening. Itâ€™s about facing reality and dealing with it, not hiding behind an IDE, PowerPoint presentation or a Gantt chart.
</blockquote>

Just because we did something a certain way two years ago doesn't mean we should still do it that way today.  Heck, when Java first came out, we used text editors and the command line, today we use full featured IDEs.  That doesn't mean we were somehow <strong>*wrong*</strong> 10 years ago.  Don't forget, for thousands of years we thought the world was flat too.

As hard as it can be to change, not doing so is a recipe for disaster.


<blockquote>Sticking to any plan or technique that is no longer appropriate is a guaranteed way to fail. Both the dodo bird and the buggy whip manufacturers learned this lesson the hard way.
</blockquote>

It's important to realize that modifying your approach isn't an admission of failure - in reality it's the mature reaction to the world around you.  It may not be easy, but the consequences of inaction are far worse than any pain the change may cause.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By now, my humble readers (pretty sure I'm up to five or six now) should know I have a <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/18/nfjs-quotes/">thing for quotes</a> and as you might expect, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/category/railsconf/">RailsConf</a> provided it's share of notable quips!  I should point out that I'm not a reporter and I didn't record any of the sessions so I'm mostly paraphrasing (if I've misquoted someone, I'll happily change it, just let me know).  Anyway, here are my favorite lines from the weekend.

When discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> and also the buzz behind <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> itself <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> said:


<blockquote>"There's a move afoot in our industry to throw away all of the crap."</blockquote>



When discussing Ajax, Dave defined it as "making browsers suck less" following with:


<blockquote>"The browser is just a 3270 terminal that can display porn."
</blockquote>


<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/index.html">Paul Graham</a> is one of my favorite writers - when he posts something new, I pretty much drop everything, print it out, and read it.  The following all belong to him.  Before diving into his <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/23/railsconf-day-1/">keynote</a>, Paul prepared us for what was about to come:


<blockquote>"I'm going to contradict both the Old Testament and Yoda."</blockquote>



<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html">His talk itself</a> provided quite a number of quotable lines including...


<blockquote>"Better to say something obliquely, then the people that would be offended won't understand it."
</blockquote>

and


<blockquote>"Don't learn things from people that are bad at them."
</blockquote>


Paul was followed up by <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">Why the Luck Stiff</a> and anyone that has seen him live knows how entertaining he is.  While I can't do justice to nearly anything he said during his show, I loved this line (if i recall properly, this caused a standing O from <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn Vanderburg</a>):


<blockquote>"Put your best practices away."
</blockquote>


Obviously, there were other memorable lines, but these were the ones I actually caught in my notes...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just wanted to point out that the <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/pages/rails/">RailsConf keynotes</a> are starting to appear on <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/">ScribeMedia</a>.  So far it's just <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/06/30/railsconf-2006-keynote-series-dave-thomas">Dave Thomas</a> and <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/07/03/martin-fowler-railsconf-2006-keynote-address">Martin Fowler</a> but I suspect the others will follow along shortly.  All the talks were great but regardless of your interest in Rails I recommend you listen to Martin, Paul Graham, and Nathaniel Talbott.  I first saw this on <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Fowler's blog</a>.

<strong>Update:</strong> DHH's <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/07/09/david-heinemeier-hansson-railsconf-2006-keynote-address">keynote</a> is now available.

<strong>Update:</strong> Paul Graham's <a title="Paul Graham RailsConf 2006 Keynote Address" href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/07/17/david-graham-railsconf-2006-keynote-address">keynote</a> is now available - go listen...right now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the hard and fast rules of web design has long been "thou shall develop for a screen resolution of 800x600."  Of course with monitors getting larger and larger (heck, this aging PowerBook runs at 1280x854) this maxim might be past it's prime.  So what's a designer to do?  Kyle Neath of <a href="http://warpspire.com/">Warpspire</a> takes a look at this question in his post <a href="http://warpspire.com/journal/ia-usability/jumping-ship/">Jumping Ship</a>.  Basically, Kyle channels <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a> (check out her <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/07/safe_is_risky_r.html">Safe is risky, risky is safe</a>) and, well, <a href="http://blog.talbott.ws/">Nathaniel Talbott</a>'s <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/09/railsconf-keynotes/">keynote from RailsConf</a> (check ScribeMedia <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/pages/rails/">for a link</a> to his talk).  While designing for the lowest common denominator can attract a large pool of customers, taking some risks opens you up to a batch of new ones.

I think Kyle hit's it on the head when he says 

<blockquote>"Making your users feel special is worth more than any advertisement could possibly cost."</blockquote>

Sure, you can play it safe, follow the well beaten path, but will that inspire <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/07/how_your_produc.html">The Nod</a>?  Of course it takes courage - it's not easy to try something different; while no one brags about their <a href="http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/2007/camry/">Camry</a>, Toyota sells a ton of them.

So what is a designer to do?  I'm with Kyle, give it a go!  If no one pushes the boundaries, we don't advance the field...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've all been there.  You get that frantic call from a customer - somehow a bug got through your intensive suite of automated tests and your kick butt QA team (must have been that dang intern).  Of course the problem has to be fixed <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong> so they can get that much needed report to that ever so important vice president allowing him to make <strong>*very big*</strong> decisions.  You dutifully dig in and, despite that queasy feeling, you put in a quick and dirty little fix.  I know, you're going to go back in and fix it just as soon as you can...but then the next day, just as you're sitting down to put in the proper patch, wham, the project manager ambushes you from behind the plastic <a href="http://www.evergrowing.com/tips/ficustree.htm">ficus</a> tree.  Can you say "cat like quickness?"

The PM has an urgent request (aren't they all?) - someone very important is going to be in the office tomorrow and needs a demo of that snazzy new feature she promised you'd add to the system (you know, the one you said was nearly impossible to do).  Don't worry about implementation, just make it <strong>*look*</strong> like it works!  If you're like most of the people I've worked with, you swallow hard and get to it pounding out something that functions...mostly.  Sure, you had to cut some corners, but it made the PM happy and, well, it <em>is</em> for an important customer.  Tomorrow though, you're going to refactor the quick fix and get the new feature squared away.

Alas the next day brings yet another crisis and your best laid plans are cast asunder.  Day after day, we are often asked to put in quick and dirty fixes.  Can it be any different?  I mean we can't possibly do quick and clean could we?  Well, <a href="http://jroller.com/page/obie">Obie Fernandez</a> thinks there's a way: <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby</a> and its close personal friend <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>.  In a recent post about <a href="http://jroller.com/page/obie?entry=thoughtworks_on_rails_enterprise_adoption">enterprise adoption</a> (essentially expanding on <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/24/railsconf-day-2/">his talk at RailsConf</a>) Obie offers some great advice on how to pitch Rails to the enterprise.  He hits it on the head when he says:



<blockquote>The biggest challenge, in my opinion, is that lots of teams doing J2EE have people are used to thinking that quick == dirty. <a href="http://metaatem.net/2006/06/23/railsconf-keynote-martin-fowler">Martin's keynote</a> had tons of good information for anyone wanting to evangelize Ruby as enabling quick and clean solutions, and well-written Rails applications are all about quick and clean.</blockquote>

 

Amen.  I've seen a ton of quick and dirty code in my day and much as it makes my stomach turn, I can empathize with the developer that did it (well, to a point).  But it doesn't have to be that way!  As <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> said, it's sure slick when you work with <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Tech/UnsetGlue.html">glue that doesn't set</a>!  Much as I'd like to think this would be a compelling enough argument to woo even the crustiest of developers, I think Obie nails the underlying problem:



<blockquote>I think the hardest thing about convincing hardcore J2EE devs would be that a lot of those programmers actually get off on the complexity and building of framework upon framework. Most people I know doing Java are not application developers! They are programmers and they like working on plumbing!</blockquote>



There's not much in the way of plumbing code in a Rails app; it feels to me like virtually every line of code is about delivering business value.  There aren't any little black boxes where people can invent massive subsystems that are little more than their personal playpen.  With the rapid feedback loops, it's darn hard to venture off on some neat little complexity hunt just to soothe your need to utilize that new library.  Or put more succinctly:



<blockquote>J2EE teams tend to be larger, due to the extra complexity. Big projects usually give individual members freedom to perform below their abilities and/or skate by working on pet projects and miscellaneous bullshit that does not add business value.
</blockquote>


It's from these folks that Rails backers will hear things like "Rails doesn't scale" or "Rails isn't ready for the enterprise" or even "Rails is <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html">inappropriate</a>".

Maybe Rails will never truly be enterprise - perhaps that's a good thing.  The contrarian nature of Rails is one of its greatest strengths and I hope it never loses that.  Rails isn't right for every application (of course we don't really know the boundaries yet) but it sure fits a big niche.  Observant organizations will hop on board, change their thinking and create some amazing applications.  Those that are dominated by a certain type of developer will invent reasons why Rails won't work and wallow in the complexity of their chosen path.  Chances are, they'll never get to quick and clean.]]></content:encoded>

I don&#8217;t know what it is about software development that makes people so willing to cut corners&#8230;even (especially) when they know better. How much pain is caused by quick and dirty solutions? How many times have you been working through some code cussing out the developer because they didn&#8217;t take an extra hour to do the right thing? Ken Schwaber hits on some of this in his talk at Google and perhaps the move towards more productive programming environments will alleviate this somewhat. [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, I <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/10/book-promotion/">posted</a> about the cool promotion on select <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a> and <a href="http://www.friendsofed.com/">Friend of Ed</a> books at <a href="http://www.bn.com/apress">Barnes and Noble</a>.  Well, I was just informed that, along with the great discount, you can win an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a>!  The details are <a href="http://www.apress.com/promo/bn/index.html">here</a> but the gist is this: take your picture at B&N in front of the display, send the pic in and you're entered in a drawing to win a 1 gig nano.  Remember, the cool kids will be reading Foundations of Ajax...  Good luck!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ryan and I are proud to announce our second collaboration, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=ntschuttacom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1590596773%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1152987234%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8">Pro Ajax and Java Frameworks</a>!  We just got our author copies so I expect it will be available shortly from the major retailers.  This book largely picks up where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595823/ref=ase_ntschuttacom-20/102-9579157-7996951?v=glance&s=books">Foundations</a> ends: after a general Ajax overview, we cover some common tools (including my new favorite <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/">Firebug</a>) then we discuss a number of frameworks (<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>, <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us</a>, <a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net/">DWR</a>, etc).  Once we've covered the client side goodness, we walk readers through integrating Ajax into common Java frameworks including <a href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts</a>, <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/">JSF</a>, <a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/">Tapestry</a>, and <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a>.

We've been thrilled with how well received Foundations has been and we hope people learn as much from reading Pro Ajax as we did writing it!

We had a great time - thanks to everyone that came, we really appreciate the support!  <a title="JJ" href="http://www.intertech-inc.com/Instructors/Default.aspx?InstructorID=6">Jeff Jensen</a> was awseome as always (sorry for giving you a bit of heartburn there my man!) and we got some great questions.  Congrats to everyone that won a book or a shirt, enjoy!

For posterity, here are the slides (you can also get them from the TC JUG site).  I added a slide on <a title="Yahoo's UI library" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo's library</a> and there's a special surprise buried in there...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Saturday, I had the distinct pleasure of presenting <a title="NFJS FoA talk" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=373">Foundations of Ajax</a> and <a title="NFJS Prag Usability" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=372">Pragmatic Usability</a> at the <a title="NFJS - Iowa" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=58">Central Iowa Software Symposium</a>.  As regular readers know, I've attended <a title="NFJS" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/index.jsp">NFJS</a> events in the past (take a look at my thoughts on this year's MN show: <a title="NFJS day 1" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/17/nfjs-day-1/">day 1</a>, <a title="NFJS day 2" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/20/nfjs-day-2/">day 2</a>, <a title="NFJS day 3" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/22/nfjs-day-3/">day 3</a> and of course <a title="NFJS quotes" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/18/nfjs-quotes/">quotes</a>) but this was my first go at actually presenting.  If you've ever attended a NF event, you know how outstanding the speakers are so I was really honored when <a title="About NFJS" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/about.jsp">Jay Zimmerman</a> gave me the green light!  Based on the feedback I received, I think I held my own which is saying quite a bit when you're sandwiched by the likes of <a title="DH" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=23">David Hussman</a>, <a title="Venkat" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=11">Venkat Subramaniam</a>, <a title="GV" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=17">Glenn Vanderburg</a> and a <a title="speakers" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_speakers.jsp?showId=58">host</a> of outstanding technical minds.

I want to thank everyone that came to my talks - especially those that came up during the breaks to chat!  Unfortunately I wasn't able to stick around for very long (though I thoroughly enjoyed <a title="SD" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=18">Scott Davis</a>' talk on <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=2329&showId=58">Easing into Agile</a> - oh, and thanks to Scott, his mom, and <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=62">Matt</a> for making me feel right at home).   My apologies for the handouts, I will get that corrected (though I know that is of little help to the good folk in Iowa).  For your viewing pleasure, I've uploaded the slides (<a title="FoA slides" href="http://ntschutta.com/slides/Foundations%20of%20Ajax%20NFJS.pdf">FoA</a>, <a title="Prag Usability" href="http://ntschutta.com/slides/Prag%20Usability%20NFJS.pdf">Pragmatic Usability</a>) and as usual these are released under a Creative Commons license.

If you're interested in hearing me present either of these talks, I'll be at the <a title="NFJS - Ohio" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=61">Southern Ohio Software Symposium</a> in two weeks - hope to see you there!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Functional Specs</title>
		<link>http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/25/functional-specs/</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2006 00:40:50 +0000</pubDate>

		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/25/functional-specs/</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Depending on who you believe, functional specs are either an <a title="Painless Functional Specifications" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html">absolute must</a> or something to be <a title="Getting Real, Step 1: No Functional Spec" href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/001050.php">avoided like the plague</a>.  While I vacillate on the necessity of written docu, if pressed I trend towards the <a title="SvN" href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">37signals</a> approach - the code never lies (misleads, sure) and iterating code tends to provide better answers anyway.  That said, there have been occasions where I <strong>*really*</strong> would have liked something more concrete than "it has to be like the old system...only better" or "the requirements are whatever I say they are".  While I'll concede the need to write <em>something</em> down, I've seen many examples that go a bit, ah, overboard when it comes to specs.  Seriously, if it <em>needs</em> a table of contents and an index, it's time to pare it down a bit.

The struggle comes down to purpose: why do we write functional specs?  Some companies believe they should be the complete conveyance between customers and developers - when you get there, you're in trouble.  By the time you've finished writing down every possibility (and sat through many, many mind numbing meetings), chances are the business has changed three or four times obviating all of your hard work.

So the question is, <a title="Venkat's blog" href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,d2b1f4d7-f914-408c-a2b4-52046a14defd.aspx">what should a requirements document provide?</a>  Agile mentor <a title="Venkat's blog" href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/default.aspx">Venkat Subramaniam</a> nails this issue right on the head - instead of trying to map every fork, provide enough depth to help the developer explore the issues.
<blockquote>Rather than providing answer to all my questions, I would like for it to help me ask the right questions when I am ready to delve into the implementation.

A great requirements document helps me not with right answers, but with right questions.</blockquote>
Keep this in mind next time you sit down to write a spec - it should aide communication, not supplant it.  Help your devs ask the right questions, don't try and answer every single one.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="Michael Mahemoff" href="http://softwareas.com/">Michael Mahemoff</a> picked up on my recent ramblings about <a title="Functional Specs" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/25/functional-specs/">functional specs</a> and adds <a title="How Much Docs?" href="http://softwareas.com/how-much-docs">his own 5 cents</a> (in my mind, his thoughts are worth more than just a couple of pennies).  I agree with Michael with regards to the dichotomy - like most things in life, docu needs exist on a continuum.  If I'm just writing a simple little app for my own use, I probably won't write much of anything beyond the code but if I'm reworking the software that keeps planes in the air, well, chances are I'll need to jot a few things down!

While needs vary, as Michael says, it's quite difficult to nail down software requirements down with any degree of accuracy.
<blockquote>The problem here, of course, is that Definitive-style docs require an almost impossible task of pinning down requirements, and furthermore, fixing requirements runs counter to the modern organisationâ€™s goal of being agile.</blockquote>
I'm not sure why companies continue to try and use <a title="Waterfall" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall">waterfall</a> like methodologies when <a title="Agile Manifesto" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile</a> appears to be the only approach that really works.  The idea that <a title="Scientific management" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Management">process can somehow replace people</a> is as old as the <a title="Ford Model T" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T">Model T</a>.  But then when was the last time you drove one of those to the office?

The real solution doesn't lie with more process or templates - it rests with better people.  I went to a small <a title="CSB/SJU" href="http://www.csbsju.edu/">liberal arts school</a> in central Minnesota.  Beyond my <a title="Comp Sci" href="http://www.csbsju.edu/computerscience/">studies in 0s and 1s</a>, I took quite a few courses from the outside the sciences, considerably more than I was "required" to take to fulfill my core credits.  That was fine with me, my interests were diverse but it always struck me as odd that science folk were required to take far more humanities stuff than the non-science types were required to take in our disciplines.  My point?
<blockquote>Thereâ€™s obviously no one solution, but one essential ingredient comes from multi-talented people.</blockquote>
In today's marketplace, we need more geeks with <a title="Customer Affinity" href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CustomerAffinity.html">customer affinity</a> (and fewer that <a title="Quick and Clean" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/11/quick-and-clean/">dig plumbing</a>)...but we also need customers with some appreciation for technology.  But then that's just my two cents.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="Joel on Software" href="http://joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a> put out a flurry of posts in the last few days including this <a title="Travelers Insurance: Drop Dead." href="http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/07/29.html">interesting look</a> at a recent <a title="Travelers" href="http://www.travelers.com/">Travelers Insurance</a> ad that depicts geeks in a rather stereotypical light.  I'm guessing a lot of folks will agree with Joel's assessment that the add is offensive - what do you think?  All I know is it sounds like he's shopping for a new policy:
<blockquote>You probably forgot that most of the people that read Inc. are geeks. And we buy insurance. Lots of insurance. Like me. And in fact I used to buy it from you. But not any more.</blockquote>
Now, I have no idea just how many geeks are covered by Travelers, but I do know that a lot of them read Joel's blog...wonder how many will join him in his boycott?  Smacks a bit of Microsoft's recent <a title="Evolve" href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/evolve/default.mspx">evolve</a> campaign and we know how <a title="Terrible Lizard, Terrible Marketing" href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/03/terrible-lizard-terrible-marketing.html">popular</a> that <a title="BillG on Dinosaurs" href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/04/billg-on-dinosaurs.html">has been</a>!]]></content:encoded>

While I certainly appreciated this attitude during the period I was looking for that all important first job, it was quite a shock when I started working with folks for whom software was just a job. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t think people have to eat, breathe, sleep this stuff (I really appreciate being able to carry on a conversation about, you know, sports or something) but to really excel at this stuff, it has to be more than a passing fancy. Yes, coders are mocked and software is incredibly artistic. And yes, companies that &#8220;get it&#8221; do extremely well. The sad thing though - few places seem to really want the passionate among us&#8230;wonder why that is. [...]]]></wp:comment_content>

Of course both of our posts went a bit beyond that, but it appears that we now have an answer from none less than <a title="Useit" href="http://www.useit.com/">Jakob Nielsen</a>.  In his latest <a title="Alertbox" href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/">Alertbox</a>, <a title="Screen Resolution" href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/screen_resolution.html">Screen Resolution and Page Layout</a>, Jakob tells us we are free to bump it up to 1024x768.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you seen that EarthLink commercial, you know, the one where they tell you that geeks get the job done?  Well, <a title="Hedius" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> is a geek - plain and simple.  His recent post, <a title="On Coding" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/07/on-coding.html">On Coding</a>, is definitely worth a read.  While I'm not nearly the night owl he is (well, when I do stay up late, I certainly don't wake up at 7 am!) I certainly identify with a lot of what he's saying.  Charles is dead on when he talks about <a title="Creating Passionate Users" href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">passion</a> and while I think it's good to have more developers with <a title="Customer Affinity" href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CustomerAffinity.html">customer affinity</a>, I want those with some zeal, dang-it!

In the late '90s, a lot of people entered this profession - if you could spell Oracle, you were golden.  While I certainly appreciated this attitude during the period I was looking for that all important first job, it was quite a shock when I started working with folks for whom software was just a job.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think people have to eat, breathe, sleep this stuff (I really appreciate being able to carry on a conversation about, you know, sports or something) but to really excel at this stuff, it has to be more than a passing fancy.  Yes, coders are <a title="Trav hates geeks?" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/31/does-travelers-insurance-hate-geeks/">mocked</a> and software is incredibly artistic.  And yes, companies that "get it" do extremely well.  The sad thing though - few places seem to really want the passionate among us...wonder why that is.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been singing the Rails front end/Java back end tune for quite a while now, especially after observing the changes in store for Java in the next year combined with the maturation of <a title="JRuby on codehaus" href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a>.  So, when I saw <a title="Rails Talk thread on Rails plus Java with JRuby" href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/508c6b7d2944d295">this post</a> come across the <a title="Rails talk list" href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk">Rails list</a> last week, it really caught my eye.  <a title="Charles Nutter Blog" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> hits the nail on the head:
<blockquote>I have also been disappointed with most of the Java-based web frameworks, almost entirely due to their over-heavy, over-complicated approaches to implementing the view and controller portions of an app. If I were to write an application now, I would give strong consideration to something more Railsy, even if it were backed by Java-based services.</blockquote>
As much as I do like Java (really, I still do!) using it to write web apps is jut plain painful.  That said, companies will be loathe to dump the massive investments they've made in Java over the last decade and rightfully so - but that doesn't mean we can't get the best of both worlds.  Imagine the speed of development inherent in the <a title="RoR" href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> world combined with the mature infrastructure of Java.  Sure seems to me like we'll be doing lots of this over the next few years...

BTW, <a title="Obie's blog" href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie">Obie Fernandez</a> posted about this <a title="Obie's post about Uncle Bob and Ruby" href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie?entry=uncle_bob_on_ruby_and">today</a> (though I've been happily reading along with the earlier posts) but did you happen to notice that <a title="But Uncle Bob" href="http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob">Uncle Bob</a> has been getting into Ruby and Rails lately?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back at dear old <a title="CSB/SJU website" href="http://csbsju.edu/">SJU</a>, <a title="Johnnie Football" href="http://www.gojohnnies.com/football/default.htm">John Gagliardi</a> (<a title="Gag's inducted to hall of fame" href="http://www.gojohnnies.com/football/times050906.htm">recent inductee</a> to the <a title="College HOF" href="http://www.collegefootball.org/">College Football Hall of Fame</a>) was fond of saying "speed kills."  Of course this was in relation to quick footed running backs or wide receivers but the adage works in other contexts as well.  As I mentioned <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/08/29/rails-java/">earlier</a>, <a title="But Uncle Bob" href="http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob">Uncle Bob</a> has been getting into the Ruby space and today he posted a very interesting <a title="Speed of Java, C++, Ruby" href="http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.SpeedOfJavaCppRuby">comparison of the speed</a> of an algorithm written in Java, C++, and Ruby.  While Ruby code is relatively slow (and the C++ wasn't highly optimized) there's more to this game than raw processing speed.

I'm not saying we should write slow code - far from it.  But, there are other considerations such as developer productivity and long term maintenance costs.  While there certainly are some applications that absolutely <strong>*must*</strong> run full bore, I suspect quite a few businesses would take a moderately slower application if it meant their development staff could deliver working code faster.  And I can't second this notion fast enough:
<blockquote>I'd rather have simple, clean, maintainable code over even 1.5 orders of magnitude in many cases.</blockquote>
Amen.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I suspected this was coming when <a title="Charles Nutter's blog" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> started posting <a title="Eclipse to NetBeans" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/09/from-eclipse-to-netbeans-part-3.html">about NetBeans</a> but today it became official: the <a title="JRuby steps into the Sun" href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/09/jruby-steps-into-sun.html">JRuby guys are now employees of Sun</a>!  It's been clear for a while now that Sun is really embracing dynamic languages (JavaOne was widely considered "<a title="JavaOne" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/10/reflections-on-javaone/">the one about scripting</a>") but this is quite a step.  Earlier, I talked about <a title="Rails and Java" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/08/29/rails-java/">Java and Rails</a> and this move by Sun further cements this stance in my mind.  I suspect this will have some interesting implications on the <a title="Enterprise Impasse" href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/09/01/enterprise-impasse">enterprise impasse</a>...

Anyway, congratulations to Charles (I'll repeat my plea to get some freakin sleep already) and <a title="Tom Enebo" href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/ThomasEEnebo">Tom </a>- best of luck you guys!  I just hope you remember us <a title="RUM" href="http://www.ruby.mn/">little people</a>...]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I discovered JC a couple of months ago when Andre Charland included code Monkey as intro to one of his podcasts.  I immediately bought 10 copies of Code monkey and then the entire collection of his MP3s.  His songs are utterly fantastic in every way.

I just got my daughter an electric guitar this past week, so I've been playing Code Monkey till my fingers are raw.

As a matter of fact, I asked Ben to ask JC to appear at the Ajax Experience party.  He answered that he'd love to come except that he is already booked that week.  That would have been great!

Other great JC songs:

The Future Soon
Ikea
Mandelbrot Set
Skullcrusher Mountain
Re: Your Brains
Big Bad World One
I Crush Everything

It's hard to choose just a few.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ryan and I were delighted to chat with the lads from <a title="ZeroLogik" href="http://www.zerologik.com/">ZeroLogik</a> late last week and the results have been <a title="ZeroLogik 38" href="http://zerologik.com/2006/10/zerologik_038_10072006.php">posted</a>.  As you might guess, we discussed <a title="Pro Ajax and Java Frameworks" href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/15/pro-ajax-and-java-frameworks/">Pro Ajax and Java Frameworks</a> along with a plethora of current events.  If you want a sense of how glamorous writing is, you'll want to give this a listen ;)  Despite some technical glitches (our call dropped a couple of times) a good time was had by all!  Thanks again to ZeroLogik for having us on and before you crank it up, please keep in mind they carry the explicit tag...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been so busy the last few weeks that I've been remiss in mentioning my schedule.  This weekend I'll be in the Toronto area at the <a title="NFJS" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=73">Greater Toronto Software Symposium</a> talking about <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=3169&showId=73">Ajax</a> and <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=372">usability</a>.  <a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/">Mr. Ashley</a> has been trying to get me to his neck of the woods for a while now, unfortunately I won't be there long enough to soak in the local flavor.  I haven't been speaking much of late so I'm really looking forward to connecting with the lads (I suspect there will be some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlers_of_Catan">Catan</a> going on...)

From there I head over to Boston for the <a href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/show_view.jsp?showId=59">Ajax Experience</a> where I will be presenting a broad overview of some <a href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=307">common Ajax frameworks</a>.  <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/index.jsp">Jay</a> and the <a href="http://ajaxian.com/">Ajaxians</a> have put together a fantastic lineup of speakers and it will be an action packed event.  A few of my friends managed to wrestle some funding from their respective employers so I'm looking forward to catching up.  It's going to be a busy week for me but I'm really excited!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The glamours life that is the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/10/18/upcoming-events/">speaking circuit</a>.  Last night around 8 PM I picked my lovely wife up at exotic <a href="http://www.mspairport.com/msp/">MSP</a> only to return 12 hours later to fly to Toronto for the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=73">NF event</a>.  In general I like MSP - well, I'm familiar with it - but I have to say, "they" have really sucked the romance out of travel.  Off with your shoes, take off your belt, put your laptop through separately please, take out your little plastic baggy full of travel size liquids and gels, throw that water away...  Man - these <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/index.shtm">new rules</a> <strong>*must*</strong> be a boon for the in airport kiosk industry.

But you know what the secret is?  Never forget, the people working here are doing their best (mostly) and their just following orders.  Be civil to them and you'll be amazed at what you get in return.  I know, some of them are, well, dinks, but a smile and a warm comment go a long way.  At least it does for me - YMMV.

Today I'm flying out of good old concourse A, a relatively new part of MSP and one I've never been to.  The kindly woman who checked me in (and also shared a neat little trick, what did I say about that smile?  No, I'm not telling...) was right - it is half way to <a href="http://www.ci.stillwater.mn.us/">Stillwater</a>!  I hope I'm not flying on the plane I see out the window...what was that I said about glamour?

Most of the time I'm traveling out of the main part of the airport where you can't go fifty feet without running into a <a href="http://www.cariboucoffee.com/">Caribou</a> or a <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/">McDonald's</a> but when you're at A, you better be ready for the duration.  Or have the time to run back to C.  Seriously, vending machines are you options down here (but they are cheaper...)  One thing I can't figure out though - why does the "the walkway is ending" voice have a British accent?  Is that particular vernacular more comforting to international travelers?  Oh well, in a few hours I'll be in Toronto settled in for what I'm sure will be a great weekend and then off to Boston for <strong>*the*</strong> <a href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/show_view.jsp?showId=59">event of the fall</a>.  Other than missing my wife, I'm pumped!]]></content:encoded>

Of course <a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2006102104712.jpg">some</a> of these hit so close to home that it is just scary - seriously I think there are days that he's just down the hall.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I began my collegiate career as a Chemistry major - the <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/chemistry/curriculum/buildtour/default.htm">shinny new chem center</a> combined with the fact that a degree in Computer Science required more than a minor in math got me thinking that mixing known carcinogens was as good a way as any to spend four years.  But then I hit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry">O chem</a> and the powers that be reduced the math content significantly so off I went to the land of compilers.  Needless to say, I took a rather, ahh unique, path through the major and while the finer points of circuit design have been lost to the ether, bits of my chemistry training still stick.  For some reason, I still remember when the concepts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy">entropy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy">enthalpy</a> were introduced during that first year chem class...

Needless to say, I was taken in by <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a>'s <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2006/11/entropic-software.html">Entropic Software</a> post.  Neal uses an interesting example to discuss the similarities between the technical definitions of entropy and information to support his central tenant that "software breeds entropy".  He continues by comparing the design of Unix and it's history of "<a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/minilanguageschapter.html">mini languages</a>" to Windows and its (I'll say it - clunky) approach to interoperating (I couldn't help but think of Martin Fowler's <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/07/03/martin-fowler-railsconf-2006-keynote-address">keynote from RailsConf</a> along with his discussion of <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DSLs</a>).  The moral of the story?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">Keep it simple</a>...ah you know the rest.

The nature of the universe is towards disorder (told you I remembered something from that chem class) and I have to agree with Neal that software tends towards complexity.  Some of this is our fault - for whatever reason people in this line of work reallllly like complexity (often for it's own sake) but the ephemeral nature of software doesn't help (c'mon how many of us have added just "one more feature" since it wouldn't be _that_ hard).  Though he doesn't explicitly mention it (until the comments) part of why <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> rocks is that it adheres so strongly to the principle of simplicity.

While I certainly don't know <strong>*what*</strong> technology will be the king in five years (even if I did I'd keep it quiet until I was able to write the definitive book on the subject) it is clear that Rails has had a major impact on how we write software.  As I mentioned in my <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/06/10/reflections-on-javaone/">JavaOne recap</a>, everyone is trying to "prove" that their approach is just as easy as Rails (or they try point out how it isn't enterprisey enough).  Neal's dead right - software wants to be complex and it takes a concentrated effort by engaged developers to do that.  Let's hope more of us are inspired by the diligence of the Rails team towards this end.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It really doesn't take much to keep developers happy - <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">fast machines</a>, a steady supply of <a href="http://www.cariboucoffee.com/">(good) caffeine</a>, interesting work on moderately <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">new technology</a>, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/www.hermanmiller.com/aeron/">comfy chairs</a>, managers that leave well enough alone...<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>'s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html">Field Guide to Developers</a> anyone? Google appears to be <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html">nerdvana</a> but I swear <a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/default.aspx">Rob Walling</a> is channeling <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/">Scott Adams</a> with his <a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/articles/Nine_Things_Developers_Want_More_Than_Money.aspx">Nine Things Developers Want More Than Money</a> (via <a href="http://erik.thauvin.net/linkblog/">Erik's Linkblog</a> from <a href="http://erik.thauvin.net/linkblog/?date=2006-11-03">Friday</a>).  Seriously, there are more than a few great quotes in there that make me think I've worked with him before (anyone else smell some similarities?)

There is abundant goodness but I wanted to highlight a few bits.  First regarding challenges:
<blockquote>Faced with the right type of challenge many developers will not stop until it's fixed, especially if it requires a particularly creative solution. Faced with the wrong type of challenge and they're back on instant messenger describing the toast.</blockquote>
I'll never forget an experience I had a few years back, right around this time of year.  It was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and another developer and I were grinding through an issue.  As was the custom at the time, after lunch the  manager came around and told everyone they could head home.  We nodded politely.  About an hour later he came back to remind us about the early dismissal.  An hour later he came over and all but ordered us to leave (we did...but not before fixing the problem).

A recent experience with a large web retailer's customer support reminded me of the importance of having a voice but Rob really nails it:
<blockquote>When a developer speaks, someone should listen. When several developers are saying the same thing, someone should listen and act...quickly.</blockquote>
Nothing is quite as frustrating as <strong>*knowing*</strong> something is wrong, saying so and being ignored.  I'm not sure what happens during the management lobotomy but many of them forget how to listen (that's assuming any of them ever possessed that particular skill).  Marriage tip - listen.  It sure would have saved me some grief over the years.

When I was in school I was really naive - I assumed that people were judged on results not by how closely they followed some silly process.  Boy was I wrong.  So many companies value process over people to point where:
<blockquote>When I got my next full-time job it felt like I was dragging 50-pound weights. For every page I wanted to build I had to call a meeting with six people. Any change to the database required three approvals. It was nuts, and applications took 5x longer to build. Talk about frustrating.</blockquote>
Frustrating is an understatement.  I'm amazed how far some companies take this and I have to wonder what would happen to a certain class of employees if meetings were reduced and we actually, you know, empowered folks to do real work.  Yeah, that'll never fly.

So I didn't bother to actually take the quiz (take a look at <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel's too</a>) but I'd be curious to know how your company scores...  Great post from a blog I'll have to check back on!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been a big fan of the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Prags</a> since I read their first book <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">The Pragmatic Programmer </a>so when they started up the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/index.html">Pragmatic Studio</a> earlier this year I knew I'd have to partake. As soon as I saw the December show in Atlanta, I pulled the trigger! I did contemplate switching to the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails/locations.html#MN">Twin Cities</a> show - but going to the ATL actually saves me travel time (seriously) and gives me an excuse to hang around with an old friend. The trip down was pretty easy though the woman in the seat next to me clearly was uneasy about flying...and it rubbed off on me.  I've never been too anxious about flying (I understand the odds) but sure felt like I was channeling some of her emotions.

Let's see, what else. For the first time ever I took a cab to the airport - that was interesting. I'm used to taking cabs/shuttles once I <strong>*arrive*</strong> but this was new. My cabbie was a transplant from the Bay area so we discussed the futility that is being a <a href="http://www.raiders.com/intro/splash.html">football</a> fan... The flight was uneventful (yeah). I was pretty amazed at how large <a href="http://www.atlanta-airport.com/">Atlanta International</a> is (next time I'm going to take the tram) and the hotel is fine - huge though. The weather is "cold" by Georgia standards (I loved the comment this morning on the news: "pipes could freeze and bring in the pets") but for Joe and I it's quite pleasant. Heck, back home we're seeing highs in the single digits - here they complain about getting into the teens...for the morning low.  Yeah.  Tomorrow (well this will be in the past by the time I post) should be great - I'm really looking forward to immersing myself in Rails for three days!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.familyguy.com/">And it begins</a>! First off, they've got the big three: wifi, power, and caffeine, you can tell <a href="http://clarkware.com/">Mike</a> and <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave</a> have done this before ;) Day one is a half day Ruby tutorial and then what I'd describe as roughly the first seven chapters of <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails2/index.html">AWR</a>. The crowd is a little quiet but all in all some good questions. So far the real value is hearing Dave and Mike pipe in with tips and tricks. No matter how many times I <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts">see</a> how fast you can get basic CRUD up with Rails, it never stops impressing me.

All in all, nothing too revolutionary today but I suspect tomorrow (again, this will be posted after the fact!) will really get things started. One thing I have to say - I really like the pace of the South. We've eaten out a couple of times now and each time they really stressed "y'all just hang around as long as you like." I'm starting to understand what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_hospitality">Southern hospitality</a> is all about.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As expected, things went up a notch today - we pretty much did labs from dawn till dusk. I wouldn't say the fire hose was on full bore and there was only one lab that I didn't manage to finish but we definitely covered some ground. The class is still following AWR pretty closely but I do appreciate the little tips and tricks Mike and Dave share as they walk through the exercises. More impressive is the live coding - I realize I'll need to do more of this next year on the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">NFJS</a> tour but it never ceases to amaze me how much Rails does with so little code.

The concepts are definitely starting to sink in and certain aspects are becoming more normal to me. Still, there's a fair amount of magic..but I feel more prepared (and motivated) to dive into the source. <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Partials">Partials</a> seem like a great idea and the ability to pass a hash of parms into the constructor of an ActiveRecorder subclass is just brilliant. Seriously, so much of this stuff is so easy it just feels like stealing. And all the time I've spent building plumbing in Java...sigh. Oh and I'm still getting a kick out of the local weather guys and how they define cold - when I checked the weather back home this morning, it was 0 so these "lows" in the 20s just don't impress me.  Big chill indeed...bone chilling.  Yeah.

Tomorrow will be Ajax day plus the future of Rails - should be interesting!

<strong>Update:</strong> OK, so Joe and I went to get a cup of coffee this morning and I have to admit...with the windchill, it <strong>*was*</strong> pretty nippy. Not as cold as home but it got my attention.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, we ended with a bang!  The morning started off with an Ajax lab (right up my alley) and I just have to say...Rails makes Ajax about as easy as it gets (hmm, I'm sensing a theme here).  I especially like the fact that I can quickly get an app working, add in Ajax, and (with almost zero effort) have a degradable system.  Oh, and <a href="http://www.rubynoob.com/articles/2006/05/13/simple-rails-rjs-tutorial">RJS</a> is just slick though it did make me question my opinions of <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a>.  Unlike a couple of my coworkers, GWT doesn't make me swoon - don't get me wrong, I think it's neat as all get out I'm just not ready to jump on the bandwagon.  But after playing around with RJS I might have to reconsider.

Most of today was a blur - we covered a lot of topics at a mile a minute.  I think <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/10/2/under-the-hood-rails-routing-dsl">routes</a> (especially named routes) are extremely cool and considering my new role at work the support for testing is just top notch.  I asked a few questions about test infecting organizations and I've got some great notes about testing in general.  The rest of the day included talk of <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">REST</a>, hooks and filters and caching finishing off with a discussion on deployment.

All in all I was quite happy with the training.  A faster pace would have been good, perhaps a few more labs, but there is a limit to what can be covered in three days with a mixed audience.  I suspect the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/railsadvanced/index.html">Advanced Studio</a> would be fantastic and I'm really thinking a <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/index.html">Rails Edge</a> would be useful (perhaps more so than <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">Rails Conf</a>...but that'll be a tough call).  I'm happy to call myself an alumni of the Studio - as expected Mike and Dave are great - if you need Rails training, I'd highly recommend <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Prag Studio</a>!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, people that know me realize I have a thing for quotes (see those from <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/02/railsconf-quotes/">RailsConf</a> as well as <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/18/nfjs-quotes/">NFJS local edition</a>). While there weren't a ton of memorable quips from my recent experience at <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic Studio</a> (see <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/12/07/rails-studio-day-0/">Day 0</a>, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/12/07/rails-studio-day-1/">Day 1</a>, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/12/08/rails-studio-day-2/">Day 2</a> and <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/12/10/rails-studio-day-3/">Day 3</a>) there were a couple that I had to share.  Again these are largely paraphrases but I think I've captured the gist.

This exchange occurred when I asked Mike how he was "hiding" his Keynote deck while in play mode (i.e., switching back to the desktop without hitting escape):
<blockquote>Mike: "Just hit H - one of the things Dave taught me."

me: "The list would be long"

Mike: "The things I learned from Dave... "

Dave: "A through H - that was H."</blockquote>
After trying app.methods in script console...  Mike said:
<blockquote>"Try app.taguri..oh wait, that's just missing the underscore, should be tag_uri, I thought that was something to do with Sushi, never mind."</blockquote>
That's not to say there weren't other interesting moments during the class ;)...but those were the ones I felt like sharing!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've all seen it. The shiny new system obviously won't solve the problem it was meant to yet the funding continues - in some cases it's even increased in a desperate effort to right the ship. Many excuses are offered but my personal favorite is the "we've already spent so much money - we can't stop now." As if throwing good money after bad is somehow a virtue.

I don't know about you, but I think it's pretty neat when two radically different bloggers comment on the same idea from different perspectives. Don't get me wrong, I expected a lot of commentary on the new <a title="iPhone" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> (yes, I want one) but last week both <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/Blog/Page.aspx?display=HotNeedleOfInquiry">Ron Jeffries</a> and the <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/">Freakonomics</a> folks struck the same cord: staying the course. Inspired by <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/iht/2007/01/13/world/IHT-13globalist.html">recent events in Iraq strategy</a>, Stephen Dubner compares Barack Obama's recent comments at a Senate hearing to behavioral economics and the <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2007/01/12/what-does-barack-obama-know-about-behavioral-economics/">sunk cost fallacy</a>. Jeffries goes a step further offering an explanation as to why leaders often prefer to <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/Blog/Page.aspx?display=StayTheCourse">stay the course</a>:
<blockquote>"Staying the course gives you a chance to be a winner, and leaves you no worse off than any other action, which guarantees you will be a loser."</blockquote>
Of course there is another reason why many managers can't bear to kill a project - that would be admitting they were wrong about something. When finally backed into a corner (or presented with overwhelming evidence) they are more likely to practice a little revisionist history than concede they were ever mistaken about a project. Maybe more projects need a <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/index.html">Zed Shaw</a> to do a little <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/essays/c2i2_hypothesis.html">analysis</a>! It may not be pleasant, but more often than not, the best outcome for a project can be an early death.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you haven't read <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a>'s "<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to India</a>", do so now. Like many of my peers, I'm wondering what will become of our industry as more and more work moves to countries with lower labor costs (I'll leave out an obligatory analysis of the increased communication costs that often offset the cheaper wages). Anyway, Chad's book offers some great advice on how to lessen the likelihood that <strong>*your*</strong> job will find it's way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai">Mumbai</a>.

One way to avoid the outsource machine is simple - supply and demand. Rather than polishing <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/2007/1/10/supply-and-demand-in-technology-skills">commodity skills</a>, spend your personal development effort on technologies that the major off shore houses aren't looking at yet (cough, Ruby, cough). It may seem a bit counterintuitive (like the <a href="http://longtail.typepad.com/">long tail</a> concept) but being fluent in a niche like Lisp could actually make you more employable than being yet another ASP guy. Not sure what to focus on? Take a look at <a href="http://google.com/trends">Google Trends</a>...

A very wise man asked me the other night how I cost justified spending my own hard earned cash on <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/12/10/rails-studio-quotes/">Rails training</a> and I replied that I see it as an investment. I still earn the majority of my income on Java work but I realize that our industry changes every day - staying ahead of that keeps me employable.]]></content:encoded>

OK, Bangalore or Hyderabad maybe, but not Mumbai. :-)

I agree - studying niche technology (and keeping up your skills in general) means maybe we still have a chance.  I saw where the outsourcing trend was actually going down though last year.  Some outsourcing works, but a lot of it requires effort that managers aren't willing to make to manage the projects correctly and some out sourcing projects don't do well because of time differences and language barriers.]]></wp:comment_content>

Don't think protectionism (trade barriers, tarrifs, farm subsidies). Think about the "Big I", Innovation. Creativity is valuable in all forms. Creativity, expressed through code, yielding innovation is the most valuable thing around. Fulfillment or grinding through requirements, that is about cost management. Innovating and creating new products, that is value!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Don't get me wrong Jamie - I'm not advocating tariffs or any thing of the sort. Ultimately a global marketplace benefits us all through cheaper goods and even more consumers to sell our wares to. However, we all need to take responsibility for our careers and make sure that we're staying abreast of what's happening (thus my class at the U this semester). Still, I think we need to address issues surrounding portable benefits (especially health care) as well as make sure individuals impacted by off shoring have access to education and retraining.

Still, to get to Greg's point, I think many companies don't grasp the full costs of moving work to other countries. While lots of great stuff can (and is) built leveraging skilled developers where ever they happen to live, communication overhead adds up. To add to that "hidden" fee, wages in many countries are rising further decreasing any savings from moving work off shore. Of course that won't stop most executives ;) Lots of great opportunities, that's for sure.

Anyway, thanks for the comments guys!]]></wp:comment_content>

I know what you mean, Most books on resume writing are terribly out-of-date. Although well intentioned and filled with other good information, most have not been updated for the job search realities of today. Surprisingly, few resume books will even mention what I am about to tell you today.

		<title>JRuby Breakfast Briefing</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Thursday, <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> and <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/ThomasEEnebo">Thomas Enebo</a> gave a "breakfast briefing" on <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a>. It's a good thing Charlie had forwarded the information on to the <a href="http://ruby.mn/">RUM</a> list because otherwise I for one never would have found it - when someone at work asked about it, Google was fruitless. Anyway, despite the quiet nature of the advertising, there was a decent sized crowd including a couple of old friends.

While I've seen the JRuby/Swing demo several times now it never ceases to impress me. The lads have been quite busy and it's clear their move to Sun has really helped them move their work along. The "schedule" for the next few months is pretty aggressive: February includes <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/1/19/rails-1-2-rest-admiration-http-lovefest-and-utf-8-celebrations">Rails 1.2.1</a> support, running Rails in <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish</a> and a public release of the <strong>*outstanding*</strong> <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tor/entry/ruby_screenshot_of_the_week1">Ruby support</a> that <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tor/">Tor Norby</a> has been baking into <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>.  Seriously, I think NetBeans will be a force in the Rails/Ruby editor market - it's very impressive.  And don't get me started about how slick it will be to deploy a Rails app to a Java web server!

Now I know that last line will probably cause a few of the Rails faithful to yack up their favorite caffeinated beverage but for many, I think it could become the deployment option of choice (for a framework that makes so many things so easy...deployment still leaves something to be desired). Of course it will also break down some of the barriers that slows Rails adoption in certain settings though I suspect some developers would sooner have their <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> sent through a trash compactor than deploy a Rails app to say, WebSphere (hmm, there might be quite a few Java programmers that don't particularly relish working with WAS).

Anyway, Charlie and Tom are looking at March as the last "pre 1.0" release with April earmarked for some heavy bug fixing. Oddly they think they'll have a big announcement in <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/index.jsp">early May</a> (can't imagine why). JRuby should do an awful lot to make Rails a first class framework in the Java space and may actually stem a bit of the "brain drain" some companies are experiencing. Look to see more and more interest in <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a> and <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2005/9/27/getting-started-with-activerecord-migrations">migrations</a> in the Java space too...

While I'm sure there are those that think Ruby on the JVM is heretical, JRuby is positioned to add even more fuel to the fire. If Rails made it OK to look at dynamic languages, JRuby is practically going to make it mandatory.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/">Uncle Bob</a> has a great post titled <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/01/26/going-fast">Going Fast</a> - a theme <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/07/11/quick-and-clean/">I visited a while back</a>. I don't know what it is about software development that makes people so willing to cut corners...even (especially) when they know better. How much pain is caused by quick and dirty solutions? How many times have you been working through some code cussing out the developer because they didn't take an extra hour to do the right thing? Ken Schwaber hits on some of this in <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7230144396191025011">his talk at Google</a> and perhaps the move towards more <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">productive programming environments</a> will alleviate this somewhat.

I found myself nodding along throughout Bob's piece and much as I hate to admit it, it comes down to professionalism. That said, there are times where we <strong>*need*</strong> to get a solution out the door today to meet a business need - still we tend to, as Bob phrases it, "treat the long term as a series of short term quick and dirty solutions." How much of this attitude is tied to the quarterly thinking engendered by most public companies' need to meet analyst expectations? I'm sure <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/">Cedric Beust</a> might argue a bit about the need for 100% code coverage but I for one would like to see more clean code.

<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a> touched on this topic in her post <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/so_it_takes_les.html">...so it takes less time</a>. To use a particularly apt analogy for me these days, nine women can't deliver a baby in one month; despite the hype, multitasking doesn't work terribly well (shocking I know). Anyway, the real money quote comes from <a href="http://www.parelli.com/info_page.php?page=professional&lit_num=1&title=Biography:%20Pat%20Parelli&t=OnePic">Pat Parelli</a>: "Take the time it takes so it takes less time." Amen. It seems so obvious yet it's so often ignored. Someday we'll learn our lesson. I hope.]]></content:encoded>

By the way, *great* content Floyd - if you haven&#8217;t been keeping track of the latest offering from Mr. Marinescu, you really should. I also posted a couple of articles on multitasking, something that I&#8217;ve commented on in Quick is Slow and You Have 11 Minutes. I pointed to two posts from Kathy Sierra: Your brain on multitasking and Multitasking makes us stupid? Along the same vein is an oldie but goodie from Joel on Software: Human Task Switches Considered Harmful. I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again - multitasking is a myth. People seem to harbor this insane notion that they can juggle half a dozen high priority tasks and do justice to them all&#8230;sorry, it&#8217;s not possible. But continue to believe that. Really.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today in <a href="http://www-users.itlabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2007/seng5199/">Dynamic Language camp</a>, we were discussing some of the myths and realities that surround the new darlings of the development world - you know things like "Ruby isn't enterprise", "I need the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/03/18/nfjs-quotes/">safety of the compiler</a>" and other assorted misconceptions. Anyway, we were talking about the importance of testing in the dynamic space and one of the students brought up null pointers and invariants.  I mentioned that static typing wouldn't prevent someone from passing a null and we went back and forth for a couple of minutes.

The conversation was great (they're a good group - very talkative which makes my job both easier and <strong>*much*</strong> more enjoyable - hmm, wonder if any of them are reading teacher's blog?!?) when, very quietly, another student threw out a killer quote:
<blockquote>"You're arguing about nothing."</blockquote>
Now <strong>*that*</strong> is geek humor! It took a while to sink in and I don't honestly know if it was intended to be funny but it really cracked me (and the students that heard it) up. Needless to say I had to repeat for everyone's consumption!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So last night I made a mistake - in a moment of weakness, I decided to get my car washed. I was so tired of all the grime that I just had to clean the old girl up. You'd think I'd learn from past transgressions, but no. The last time I washed my car, the very next morning it snowed, turning my quiet commute into, well, a not so quiet one.

Yes, I should have known better especially when the weather person on the radio said there was a 50/50 chance of snow in the morning. But by then I was committed. Maybe not in the "<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000704.html">pig</a>" sort of way but there was no turning back. Oh well. The astute reader would note that I'm <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/02/04/gateway-jug/">speaking in St. Louis</a> today and seeing as I don't live in or near St. Louis this implies a trip <a href="http://www.mspairport.com/msp/default.aspx">MSP</a>. Ordinarily I'm the type that gets to the airport with plenty of time to spare...but not today.

I should have just listened to my wife. She left for work at the normal hour and called me 30 minutes later to say she'd almost spun out in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_Junction">Spaghetti junction</a>. I was a bit alarmed but as my initial plan allowed me two and half hours of travel time, I wasn't concerned. And as I headed on down 35, things seemed fine - I was clipping along thinking about the <a href="http://www.cariboucoffee.com/">mocha</a> I would enjoy while waiting for my plane. But then it happened.

Just south of the last exit for several grueling miles, traffic came to an almost complete stop. For about five miles I was literally idling my way along. To say it was painful just doesn't do it justice - a stretch that normally takes 10 minutes was pushing an hour. I glanced at the clock, did some math and called my wife. At this moment I figured there was <strong>ZERO</strong> chance I'd make my flight...none. I had her call <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">Jay</a> and the travel guy to see what my options were. Of course if you've flown you pretty much know you must actually miss your flight before you have any chance at redemption.

After what I can only describe as an eternity, I was finally able to exit the parking lot that was 35E south. I figured I was home free. Oh. How. Foolish. Highway 96 wasn't much better and again a few miles took torturous amounts of time. By now I was thirsty and the windshield wipers were working overtime. After agonizingly slow progress I was finally able to head south - towards my ultimate destination (though the idiot that decided she should plow ahead as I was turning left on a yellow arrow - I'm not sure what you were trying to prove by gunning it off the green light but good for you for almost clipping me, I'm sure that would have gotten you to work right quick).

Lexington avenue was moving right along and for the first time all morning rays of hope warmed my face. I thought there might be a chance - slim as it may be - to make my flight. Off I drove cutting over to Snelling which would take me most of the way to the airport. Woops, got a little ahead of myself.  Though not nearly as bad as 35E, Snelling wasn't good. My wipers were so bad I had to make a pit stop...but I soldiered on.

Eventually I started making good time though again, looking at the clock I was quite certain I'd have an afternoon at the airport. Eventually I found my way to West Seventh and things were nearly falling into place. <strong>FINALLY</strong>, I was at the airport...now all I need is a parking space. I mentioned the snow right?  Well, the spiral drives at the parking ramp aren't exactly "<em>dry</em>" by this point in the morning - something I become acutely aware of as my all wheel drive SUV starts to slide a bit going up the embankment. Of course there's someone <strong>*right*</strong> on my tail...  But I manage to get to the second floor where the signs assure me I'll find parking.

Around and around I go wondering where these alleged spots are. Again checking the clock wondering how a mere inch of snow turns a 45 minute drive into a three hour slog... Hey, what's that over there?  A SPOT!!!  Oh joy!  Off I rush to the skyway frantically telling my wife I've arrived. At this point my flight is boarding - no doubt about that - and I haven't cleared security. But I remember back to <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/10/20/ah-travel/">my last trip</a> out of the A concourse when the very nice Northwest agent told me about the security checkpoint for carry on only.

What's that sign say?  Checkpoint this way!  Off I go figuring it'll be easy to spot.  Not so much.  I take the tram to the only stop and look around confused.  Oh, I see, the security checkpoint sign is by those stairs over there - the ones you'd know to go up if you knew where the magic entrance was. That wasn't quite the end of my searching but needless to say I did find what I was after.

I ask the TSA agent if I have a shot of making my flight, he looks at his watch and says no problem (which leaves me thinking - are you going to beam me to the gate?) After going through the metal detector twice (darn cell phone) I quickly grab all my stuff and prepare for the sprint I'm about to undertake to the other side of the world. As I've described before, the A concourse is a bit of a hike and I'm going out 12 - which darn near is in <a href="http://www.ci.stillwater.mn.us/">Stillwater</a>. I huff and puff and show up just in time...  Though I wasn't the last person on the plane, it was tight.  But I made it.  And I'm now in St. Louis.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've already described my harrowing <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/02/06/snow-rush-hour/">mad dash to the airport</a> but there were a couple of other random travel notes I just had to throw out there. First of all, I've traveled on some smallish planes this year but Tuesday was the first time I've ever heard a stewardess utter these very comforting words "Someone from the first two rows needs to move to the back of the plane to balance out the weight." Huh. So, this aircraft is so sensitive that we need to move a couple of hundred pounds 30 feet. Well, that makes me feel <strong>*very*</strong> secure. I know this is pretty standard but still, gives a guy pause...

As you no doubt know by now, it was <a href="http://climate.umn.edu/doc/journal/snow070206.htm">snowing</a> on Tuesday which means <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deicing">deicing</a>. Frankly, I wasn't that concerned - it wasn't that snowy (though it was <a href="http://wcco.com/weathernotebook/local_blogentry_037165514.html">plenty cold</a>) but still, flying in less than ideal conditions makes you think. Anyway, the first officer gave us the spiel about how we'd be taxiing to the deicing station where we'd stop and then we'd be off. After getting a bath in propylene glycol, we were ready to roll...well, not quite. At one point my seat mate leaned over and quipped "I didn't realize we were driving to St. Louis." I'm sure it wasn't that far but it really did seem like we'd be "driving" for quite some time and I was starting to wonder what the time limit was on that deicing fluid...

Speaking of which, the spare pilot (seriously, what <strong>*is*</strong> their role? Don't get me wrong...redundancy in pilots is a good thing...) makes a comment along the lines of "we are really hoping to get in the air shortly or else we'll have to return to be deiced." Huh. Not that I really wanted to return to the terminal area but I couldn't help but wonder - should we really be taking off with the deicing fluid at the end of it's effective life span? Obviously, it wasn't a problem but still...

One last little travel note - why is it, when you have <strong>*plenty*</strong> of time to get to your gate, it's about 50 feet from the security checkpoint but when you're rushed, it's on the other end of the world? Leaving St. Louis, I alloted ample time (hey, I learned my lesson...) and while I didn't expect any issues getting through security, of course my gate was literally down the hall from where I went through the gauntlet that protects the world from dangerous shampoo. Oh well, who ever said this speaking gig wasn't glamorous huh?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Death by PowerPoint</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A while back, the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_list.jsp">Fluff Talker</a> list had a bit of a debate over the merits of <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/default.aspx">PowerPoint</a> vs. <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Apple's Keynote</a>. Since I've move to the Mac, I've done all my presenting in Keynote and frankly I haven't looked back; at first it was a bit of an adjustment but all in all, I liked it quite a bit. I've seen a lot of great decks in Keynote including the <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2006/05/al_gore_another.html">drop dead gorgeous </a>work seen in an <a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/">Inconvenient Truth</a>. When I complimented <a href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/">Bill Scott</a> about his <a href="http://billwscott.com/share/presentations/aeboston/">presentation at AE</a>, he humbly gave Keynote the credit (seriously, Bill is something else - if you have a chance to see him live, do not hesitate.)

Anyway, I've spent a lot of time in Keynote and I've been trying to mimic the "<a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2005/10/the_lessig_meth.html">Lessig method</a>" of presenting (<a href="http://lessig.org/freeculture/free.html">free culture</a> is a great example, but you owe it to yourself to watch Dick Hardt's <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">OSCON 2005 Keynote</a>). I've seen <strong>*way*</strong> too many bullet point infested decks (it should be illegal to indent more than once) and I've been doing my part to stem the tide. At the day job, I've been pounding out a deep dive on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> and since work is all about Windows, I find myself again in PowerPoint. I have to admit, I really wish I wasn't. Trying to bend PPT to my will is proving difficult though I think much of the blame belongs to our corporate template - one that practically forces bullet point upon bullet point. Much as I want to blame crappy slideware on the presenters, maybe we need to "reeducate" those wonderful people that piece together lackluster themes. Or at least those swell souls that dictate all presentations shall be in said stifling framework.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Scott - good comment! I'm amazed at how many other wise well educated people that can't help reading slides...I mean, how insulting - I can read thanks ;) Of course reading is one of the reasons I'm revolting against the bullet point model; I'd rather people were listening to me not reading my slides.

Tufte is great, I *really* want to see him present live someday. I've heard great things about his classes - just have to hope he comes to town someday. Thanks for the comment - it reminds me that I owe you some dates don't I? Sorry about that!]]></wp:comment_content>

I've read Guy's article and it's top notch - as is his blog. I really regret I didn't know about his recent trip to the TC area until it was too late to see him...sigh.  I don't use the Mac because I typically need to use Live Meeting and connect to the network - neither of which is really conducive to using my hardware. When I do dry runs for NF or other events, I bring in the real deal.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since I practically goaded <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn Vanderburg</a> into the conversation, I just have to point to a very insightful post he wrote entitled <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/Software/Development/building_bridges.rdoc">Bridges and Software</a>. In general I have a hard time wtih most of the comparisons of software - push comes to shove, software is like, well, software. It isn't a pure construction process but then little of what we create would be classified as art. That said, I tend to think ours is a craft more closely aligned with the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/articles/ArtInProgramming.pdf">later</a> than the former.

Anyway, I was particularly struck by the fact that Robert Maillart's bridges were originally derided while the "state of the art" produced one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge#First_bridge">most widely known engineering failures</a>. I can't help but think - what "truth" do we hold so dear today that will soon be considered folly (I'm hoping useless meetings and process definition teams)? What object or scorn today shall soon be seen as state of the art (please let it be <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/?p=89">offices</a> with flat panel monitors and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html">comfortable chairs</a>). Great post Glenn!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Old Ajax hand <a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/blogs/brentashley/">Brent Ashley</a> has broken what I can only hope was a self imposed silence today with <a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/blogs/brentashley/2007/02/12/javascript-the-web-20-developers-babelfish/">Javascript - the Web 2.0 developerâ€™s Babelfish</a>. I must say I agree with Brent's "unformed" idea: some of today's popular JavaScript libraries try to make JS "feel" more like a different language. I make this point when I talk about Ajax or when people quiz me about which library is perfect for them - if <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> makes your skin crawl, chances are you won't like <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> and many of the Java guys I know adore <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> since it allows them to stay in their comfort zone.

As much as I agree with his post, never forget that JavaScript is JavaScript - a <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=cccd4aa02a3993ab06e56af731346f78.1710507">perfectly fine language</a> thank you very much. It's natural to <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/02/12/software-is-like/">make analogies</a> but those can be dangerous ;)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day I gave a presentation with a set of links in it and when I mentioned that to my friend Charles (no, not <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">that</a> one) he said post them to the blog. So, let it never be said I don't listen to my constituents!

First and foremost is an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/poppendieck-lean-2007">interview</a> with Mary and Tom Poppendieck over on <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a>. By the way, <strong>*great*</strong> content Floyd - if you haven't been keeping track of the latest offering from Mr. Marinescu, you really should. I also posted a couple of articles on multitasking, something that I've commented on in <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/01/28/quick-is-slow/">Quick is Slow</a> and <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/01/18/you-have-11-minutes/">You Have 11 Minutes</a>. I pointed to two posts from <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a>: <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/03/your_brain_on_m.html">Your brain on multitasking</a> and <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/03/multitasking_ma.html">Multitasking makes us stupid?</a>  Along the same vein is an oldie but goodie from <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html">Human Task Switches Considered Harmful</a>. I've said it before and I'll say it again - multitasking is a myth. People seem to harbor this insane notion that they can juggle half a dozen high priority tasks and do justice to them all...sorry, it's not possible. But continue to believe that. Really.

Anyway, from the look of my inbox I'm going to have to do a deck clearer post...there's been a lot of great articles out there that I've been meaning to comment on but have lacked sufficient time (something that I'll have in even shorter supply in coming weeks!) If you're getting the snow we are here, I hope you don't have to drive anywhere this weekend...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/02/24/links-for-charles/">mentioned yesterday</a>, it's time to clean out the old inbox of all the bits and pieces that have been stacking up. These aren't in any particular order and they'd all justify a full write-up but I'd rather get them out there than have them stagnate in the email bucket.  Enjoy!

First off, I'm on a bit of a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> kick. Here is a short riff titled <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/02/what_smart_boss.html">What smart bosses know about people who read blogs</a>. Maybe I'm wrong for being somewhat amazed at how many folks in this industry don't read blogs - but at least I'm not alone.  <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/index.html">Eric Sink</a> covers this point in his post <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/articles/Boundaries.html">Baptists and Boundaries</a> where he asserts (correctly) that most software engineers don't read blogs. Ask yourself: what kind of people do you want on your staff? Those that, when the day is done, got home and watch the latest in reality television or those that are passionate enough to crack a book?  Sadly, most managers want <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/02/sheepwalking.html">Sheepwalkers</a>.

Some of this, I suspect, is a fear of failure and it's clear that most people would rather fail conservatively than succeed in a radical manner (I know I'm quoting someone but I can't seem to find the attribution, shout if you know but for now, take a look at this <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/ASD_book_extract:_%22Individuals%22">excerpt</a> from <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/Main_Page">Alistair Cockburn</a>). Of course what it means to fail is a very fluid concept that Seth touches on in <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/02/the_tyranny_of_.html">The Tyranny of Opportunity Cost</a>.

Let's get back to that passion bit. <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a> has a great post entitled <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/02/dont_ask_employ.html">Don't ask employees to be passionate about the company!</a> Amen. I know why C-level types are such cheerleaders but I'm always surprised when people wonder why the rank and file aren't.

So these last two pieces aren't related at all to the previous ones (hey, this is a tab clearing exercise!) but they're still very interesting. <a href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/">James Duncan Davidson</a> comments on the <a href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2007/01/more_on_java_an.html">lack of Java</a> on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> but what really caught my attention was this quote:
<blockquote>For me, having Java was really important. But after I left Sun and talked to more end-users, I realized that as an end-user, the technology used to create something is not important. The important part is the result.</blockquote>
Couldn't have said it better myself. Ryan sent me this <a href="http://www.malsup.com/jquery/taconite/#overview">link</a> to a <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> plugin for <a href="http://taconite.sourceforge.net/">Taconite</a>. Very cool stuff!

Last but certainly not least, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> has a very interesting post titled <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/10/Comparing-Frameworks">Comparing Frameworks</a>. The moral of the story - you can't really say Java is "better" than Rails without defining what you mean by better. What do you care about more? Notice where he ranks the options in regards to developer speed and maintainability. Last I checked, most of our projects spend the <strong>*vast*</strong> majority of their life in maintenance mode and I don't think I know too many customers that want their projects later than sooner. Anyway, good read.

Whew, that helps ;) Looks like most people here in the big Minnie will be spending significant portions of today just <a href="http://www.kare11.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=245129">digging out</a> from the <a href="http://wcco.com/topstories/local_story_055132856.html">snow</a> we got/are still getting. Oh well, this <strong>*is*</strong> Minnesota after all. I hope you're reading this somewhere warm and dry!]]></content:encoded>

I'm sure we've all experienced a few of those over the years...  Coincidence?  I think not!]]></content:encoded>

I'm a huge fan of the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> tour (yeah, I know - I could be seen as "biased") and I've wholeheartedly recommended it to many, many people over the years.  For those of you who have (inexplicably) ignored my advice, you can get a flavor of what a typical symposium is like by reading the latest and greatest No Fluff Just Stuff Anthology, Volume II.  That's right, for a low low price, you can have your very own copy of what will, I'm sure, be lauded as one of <strong>*the*</strong> great works of the 21st century (to point, the chapter on usability is top notch!)  But don't just take my word for it, see what <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/index.html">Neal "let's-see-how-many-books-I-can-write-in-one-year" Ford</a> (otherwise known as the cat wrangler of the anthology) has to say <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2007/03/anthologization-redux.html">here</a>.  You can order your very own copy from the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/nfjs07/index.html">Prags</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNo-Fluff-Just-Stuff-Anthology%2Fdp%2F0978739280%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1174156201%26sr%3D8-1&tag=ntschuttacom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Amazon</a> (don't forget, Anthologies make <strong>*great*</strong> gifts).  Enjoy!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I ran into this <a href="http://davidweiss.blogspot.com/2007/03/cool-kids.html">hierarchy of programming languages</a> over at <a href="http://davidweiss.blogspot.com/index.html">David Weiss</a>' blog (originally posted by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/steverowe/archive/2007/03/14/programming-language-hierarchy.aspx">Steve Rowe</a>). It's quite humorous (seriously, VB is higher up than Ada?) and I'm sure it's just understood that Smalltalkers are superior to everyone!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've ever registered with <a href="http://www.javaranch.com/">JavaRanch</a> then you're familiar with the rules. It may seem like a stretch, it can take a long time to read and it's probably really hard for some folks. But it's not new...no, most of us learn the rules pretty early - before we even head to school. That rule? It's simple - be nice. That's it. Amazing how much ground that covers and talk about creating community. Ever wonder why it took so long for "the rest of the world" to get online? Have you ever <strong>*read*</strong> some usenet postings? Talk about mean...sure, I understand where some of it comes from, I really do. Heck, I was picked on in grade school (who wasn't?) but that doesn't give me (or anyone) the right to take potshots at people.

But anonymity is a powerful drug especially for a certain kind of person. In case you hadn't heard, tech luminary Kathy Sierra has been <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html">receiving misogynistic death threats</a>. That's right. Death threats. I can't for the life of me imagine the type of individual (or perhaps group) that dreams up the kind of trash that Kathy has had thrown at her in the last month. As a speaker and author, I've come to expect a certain amount of criticism and though it certainly hurts you learn to take it in stride. You also realize that someone will find fault in <strong>*anything*</strong> you do. That's OK, it's the cost of doing business; I'm a big boy and I try not to take it personally. But when it goes over the line...that just can't be supported.

I'm a huge advocate of free speech and sometimes that must be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/22/AR2007032201882.html">anonymous</a>. That said, I cannot abide by the assault that has been perpetrated against a person I deeply respect. Kathy is popular for a reason - she's a great author, a fantastic speaker and her blog deserves its place in the "a-list." It's a small token, I know, but I hope Kathy realizes just how much her voice means to me and <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/03/27/Consider+The+Effect+Of+Your+Words+Before+You+Post+Or+Comment.aspx">many</a> <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a7121d6b-19bc-49ab-aca5-eee06527eee1">others</a>. We're behind you and I'm sure those that perpetrated the threats against you will be brought swiftly to justice.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was very saddened to read <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/04/my_favorite_gra.html">this</a> today on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a>'s blog:



<blockquote>This will be the last post here quite some time, until I figure out what to do next.</blockquote>

 

While I completely <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/03/27/be-nice/">understand</a> where she's coming from, I will <strong>*greatly*</strong> miss her voice in the blogosphere. My day was always a bit brighter when my aggregator showed there was something new on Creating Passionate Users and I for one hope that Kathy quickly finds a way to continue spreading her message in a way that she's comfortable with. I further regret never having seen her present live - I'll just have to settle for the podcasts. It is so very sad that some incredibly small people were able to distinguish a light so bright. Here's to you Kathy, you will be missed.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Early Morning</title>
		<link>http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/04/07/the-early-morning/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm not really a morning person (thank god for <a href="http://www.cariboucoffee.com/">Caribou</a>), but I've always preferred getting an early start to the day; arriving at work before the sun peeks its head over the horizon gives you an interesting perspective. For example, near where I work there's this bar and I always know what day it is by how many cars are still in the parking lot when I'm heading into the object factory. It's not uncommon to see half a dozen vehicles scattered around the lot on a Friday morning and frankly I take some comfort in the fact that these folks were wise enough to take a cab or hitch a ride.

Now, I expect to see some cars left overnight at the bar but there's something I've noticed of late that doesn't quite make sense. <a href="http://www-users.itlabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2007/seng5199/">Dynamic language camp</a> starts promptly at 8 am (OK, not always so promptly) which means I'm usually walking in around 7:30 or so. Every morning as I stride towards the EE/CSci building I'm perplexed by the sheer number of bikes that are securely attached to the racks fronting the facility. I understand the case for Friday mornings, but I don't recall there being too many 8 am Saturday classes when I was in college.

Needless to say, I find myself constructing the conversation between two students as they walk out from a late night hackfest. One guy stumbles towards his two wheeled transport but his buddy grabs his arm "hey, you've had too much Jolt tonight man, give me the keys to the bike lock." Maybe there really are some extremely dedicated students out there, I don't know. But I like to think we've got some real heroes stepping in to prevent the tragedy of a wired geek trying to navigate his way home after another long night in the lab.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tab Clearing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's time for <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/02/25/bits-and-pieces/">another tab clearing</a> exercise... I always have such high hopes that I'll have time to do full write-ups for all of the stuff that piques my fancy but Kathy Sierra nails it when she talks about the <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/04/the_myth_of_kee.html">myth of keeping up</a>. Anyway, in no particular order here are some links that have been burning a hole in my browser - or some such hacked metaphor.

<a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/category/tims-tepid-torrent">Tim Ottinger</a> over on the <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/">Object Mentor blog</a> has been posting some great stuff of late including this piece on <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/03/23/solution-probleming">solutions finding problems</a>. I'm sure we've all got a favorite story about a coworker (always a coworker...right?) that wields a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hammer">Golden Hammer</a> or falls in love with a pattern and uses it again, and a again...and again. And of course there is always the project manager that says "we got x patterns in this release - we're going for the rest in the next iteration." Yeah. And while developers are usually to blame for tool abuse, corporate policy often dictates a team will use all that pours forth from the (insert your favorite large company here) sales spigot. Anyway, good read.

Also from Tim is this piece on <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/03/22/zero">zero</a>. I remember a long time ago when a senior engineer dropped the old "there are only three numbers, zero, one, and everything else" on me, but this quote really struck a nerve:



<blockquote>However, my manager was secretly reporting our progress in terms of lines of code/week. I was called on the carpet after some very productive weeks of producing unusually clean code. My managerâ€™s problem was that we had been averaging over 200 lines less per week. By making the system cleaner and smaller, we were being reported as making negative progress, and were ordered to stop!

Itâ€™s just another â€œbad metricsâ€ story, but it underscores an unspoken assumption that code should always grow bigger over time.</blockquote>



Oh man - I can relate. Boy can I. Bigger isn't always better (as my belt can attest) but that doesn't seem to stop most developers from adding more and more and more. The true artist knows that what is left <strong>*out*</strong> is just as important as what is put in.

Nat Torkington's post on <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/the_future_of_w_1.html">The Future of Web 2.0</a> is a must read - very funny! Personally, I think Web 95 will be the real step forward though I'll try to hold out for Web XP.

Stephen J. Dubner has an interest take on <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2007/03/21/herd-mentality-the-freakonomics-of-boarding-a-bus/">boarding a bus</a>. He discovered that a couple of hundred yards actually saved him time - he'd make the first bus and gave him a decent chance of securing a seat. I'm constantly amazed at how people become so blind to alternatives, be it solutions to a problem or quicker routes out of parking lots. Most people will wait and wait to make a left when a handful of rights will get you there faster. Oh well, that works out well for me.

<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> talks about <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/03/the_disappointm.html">noisy people</a> and points to a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFP0q4qzGw4">video</a> that you've got to watch. Oh how we shun the nonbelievers.... Speaking of Seth, Presentation Zen <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/03/seth_godin_idea.html">links</a> to a Godin video, well worth the few minutes of time. And speaking of videos, Scoble has an <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/03/30.html">interview with non other than Joel Spolsky</a>. You have your choice of the full hour plus or <a href="http://www.podtech.net/scobleshow/technology/1415/editors-choice-best-of-joel-spolskys-interview">6 minutes</a> - your call ;)

Well, that ought to buy me a few days...enjoy!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, so maybe these observations are only interesting to me but what do you expect - it's Friday night and I'm siting in the middle of good old A concourse (as I've said <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/10/20/ah-travel/">before</a>, this traveling stuff is so very <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/02/08/random-travel-notes/">glamorous</a>). That's right, sometime early Saturday morning I should find myself in <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=94">Oklahoma</a> for the next <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff</a> event...and since I breezed through security, I've got some time to kill. Anyway, couple of things caught my attention this week.

Now, as anyone that knows will attest, you won't often find me at the gym blasting my quads. But occasionally guilt or some perverse sense of pride prods me into wandering in and breaking a sweat. Yesterday just happened to be one of those days and I couldn't help but notice the promotion the club was running (posters were everywhere...you couldn't avoid them). The idea was, refer 5 people and you get your name in a drawing. All right, that makes sense - drum up some leads from your current members. And the grand prize really was something though I suspect it might have a perverse affect on the member that won it, you see, they were giving away a Bow Flex, that king of infomercial hard bodies (something tells me they do a little more than 30 minutes 3 days a week - or perhaps they don't eat.) Maybe it's just me, but it seems somewhat counterintuitive for a health club to award a member something that, in theory, obviates the need for a membership. But I suppose you'd really just lose that one member...

Today at the airport something else stood out in my sleep deprived mind. If you've ever been as <a href="http://www.mspairport.com/msp/">MSP</a>, you know that A concourse is, well, nearly in Stillwater and the easiest way to get out there is on the tram. Like their weak cousins the moving walkway, trams area  staple at airports big and small and most seem to be operated without a human driver. That makes sense, it couldn't be <strong>*that*</strong> hard to program right? Anyway, it has been raining here in the big Minne and as I looked out the front of the car, I noticed a windshield wiper. Now, there's no driver...but we've got a windshield wiper. I appreciate the clear view of the track ahead but I can't help but wonder what purpose that serves. Do people somehow feel better knowing that the the window is free of precipitation? Could be.

Well, I suppose that's enough random chatter for now. By the time I post this I'll be begging for some espresso...and missing home.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I hope the winner of the BowFlex can opt to get cash instead.  The thought of having to deal with the prize is a deterrant to even participating.  If I did win the prize, I can envision the following turn of events.

Find a place to put it; unpack it; drink a beer; spend a couple minutes looking over the instructions; set it up; take it apart because I put it together wrong; have another beer; put it together again; have another beer; try it out; injure myself because I used it while intoxicated; never use it again; take it apart so I can move it to my new house; start over at the first step.

As for the windshield wiper on the tram - I wonder if they do it because it's  stylish.  I also wonder if they had to pay more money to add the windshield wiper.  I've never been on a tram before, but it would be cool if you could drive it manually wherever you wanted, in which case the wipers might come in handy in case you hit a fire hydrant.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been meaning to blog this for a couple of weeks now but for some reason (oh, that's right, the little rug rat) the only time I find to write is when I'm sitting in airport terminals. Today I find myself in the glorious C concourse at <a href="http://www.mspairport.com/msp/default.aspx">MSP</a> even though I'm taking one of my shortest hops of the year - all the way to <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/06/26/wisconsin-jugs/">Milwaukee</a>! It's just a good thing I married one of the most understanding women on the planet; after leaving her to play man up on the little one for the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=84">weekend</a>, I've increased the challenge by disappearing during the week. Thank god I can compare my travel to <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/">Venkat</a>!

Anywho, two weeks ago I found myself fixing some JavaScript and I was reminded why I <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">so love dynamic languages</a>. We had a situation (two actually) where I had to add additional parameters to an existing method to clean up some issues that were showing up on one particular page. Since JavaScript isn't too particular on method signatures, I was able to make the changes without impacting *any* existing calls to the method - they weren't even aware I made the change. Now, I know that in static language land, I could have just overridden the method but then I'd be left with those little one line orphans that do nothing but call the new improved function. Oh, and I would have had that wonderful recompile stage! Small thing, but I was just ever so tickled that I could quickly and easily fix a specific problem without fear of disrupting other code.

Just last week I had another "<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">dynamic languages rock</a>" moment. One of the interns has been busy getting <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> working on some simple scripts to help out with a couple of things. First, he wrote - in just a few hours - a Groovy script that combined a handful of JavaScript files into one (akin to what the <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> folks do). Thanks to <a href="http://www.davisworld.org/">Scott</a>'s presentation, he was up and running in almost no time. His productivity was quite something - it seemed like he was asking for more constantly. I'll be the first to admit that I had mostly written off Groovy what with <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a> and all, but after seeing what we were able to do in just a short amount of time, I'm definitely on the bandwagon. But then it's not a zero sum game ;)

Now I'm sure some will call the tasks we accomplished in the last couple of weeks "trivial" or perhaps "academic" but I just don't care. Groovy scratched an itch and JavaScript is one again reminding me that it's a first class language; perhaps even the <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.html">next big thing</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've seen my share of spam over the years and most of the time I'm just stunned anyone falls for it. I mean, come on - who actually thinks that some stranger needs to move 10 or 20 million in hard currency out of their war torn/ravaged country and for some reason they trust YOU to help with this critical mission? Sure, it sounds like a great deal but, gez, I doubt my 4 month old would fall for that. But, we don't live in <a href="http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/?refid=6">Lake Wobegon</a> so it I suppose it shouldn't be that surprising. Anyway, of late there's been some spam on the <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> discussion <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/firebug">group</a> and while I've deleted most of it on site, this one caught me eye:



<blockquote>Road Map To Riches - Another 2-UP Scam

Road Map To Riches is yet Another 2-Up scheme in the pipeline! Akin to EDC Gold and Passport to Wealth among others, this program is designed to suck gobs of cash out of you and leave you wallowing in your embarrassment for having been so foolish.
</blockquote>


Wow, how refreshingly honest! I really pity the person that falls for that line.]]></content:encoded>

Whether you're a seasoned Ajax vet or someone that's just trying to get your head around what the heck XHR is, RWE has <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/show_topics.jsp?showId=60">something</a> for you. The <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/show_speakers.jsp?showId=60">lineup</a> looks absolutely fantastic and I'm excited to be a part of the event - if you're interested in going, you can get a $200 discount by using this promotion code: nfjs2007speaker200. I'll be doing an overview of various Ajax libraries, a deep dive on Prototype, and a talk on how to add Ajax to an existing application. Hope to see you there!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As my regular reader knows, I've been doing a fair bit of traveling the past couple of years and while I mostly tolerate the <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/">security theater</a> (seriously - a laptop battery is far more dangerous than shampoo) I'm still amazed at what people try to do. Maybe I've just been traveling too much, but how can you not know about the (silly) <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/9-25_updated_passenger_guidance.shtm">liquid rules</a>? Even if you haven't read them, most of the airports I've been flying through are continually reminding passengers about the magical quart bags via the public address system. As if that weren't enough, there seem to be signs everywhere - many conveniently located right at the head of the security line where in some cases you can actually get a complimentary plastic bag (who said all the romance was gone from traveling?)

Flying home from <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=84">Salt Lake City</a> one guy tried to carry on full bottles of mouth wash and liquid soap - he seemed <strong>*stunned*</strong> that they weren't going to let him through. Of course that was topped by the woman that was behind me coming back from <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/06/26/wisconsin-jugs/">Milwaukee</a>. She had what can best be described as a pallet of bottled water she brought from home and seemed quite put out that the screener was going to make her throw all that reasonably priced liquid refreshment in the trash. But that doesn't hold a candle to the things that get <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118463087155468285.html?mod=todays_us_page_one">confiscated on a daily basis</a> - apparently you can get a pretty good deal on an impact drill if you're willing to hunt the government warehouse store. And how can two people a week walk through security forgetting that only air marshals and pilots get to carry heat? Of course the real thing to remember - don't carry anything through security that a <a href="http://www.natch.net/stuff/TSA/">TSA agent doesn't understand</a> (via <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/07/the-security-sa.html">Threat Level</a>)...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, a friend of mine and I were talking about the <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/">Big Ball of Mud</a> pattern especially as it pertains to staffing. When you're dealing with spaghetti, technical skills aren't nearly as important as familiarity with the code, a truth captured nicely in this quote:



<blockquote>...architects depart in futility, while engineers who have mastered the muddy details of the system they have built in their images prevail...This advantage can extend to those programmers who can find their ways around such code. In a land devoid of landmarks, such guides may become indispensable.
</blockquote>


Now, I understand that in many organizations, knowing the path through the swamp is a vital skill and many individuals have made very good livings out of being guides. But problems crop up when people start confusing comprehension with competence - knowing the back way to your house doesn't make you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan">Magellan</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's a Friday night and as you might expect of someone with a young sentient being in his care, I'm not at the local bar killing off precious brain cells. No, on this beautiful evening I'm enjoying the hospitality of one of the many Northwest gates at good old <a href="http://www.mspairport.com/msp/default.aspx">MSP</a>. Yes, that's right, I'm on my way to someplace even hotter than the big Minne has been the last few weeks - I'm heading to the "<a href="http://www.azcentral.com/weather/">dry heat</a>" of <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_view.jsp?showId=87">Phoenix</a>. I've made the joke about Minnesota winters and a dry cold but how you can say temps in the hundreds are anything but oppressive is beyond me. Oh well, as is typical of my trips these days, I'll see little more than the airport, a shuttle bus, and a hotel ballroom.

As luck would have it my already late night flight is delayed - so far by only half an hour but still...good thing I'll be sleeping in tomorrow! Sitting here in the G concourse I'm reminded of just how self absorbed people can be. On one side, I've got the guy who thinks his Bluetooth headset requires that he SHOUT to be heard by his friends - either that or he thinks the rest of us really care whether or not his anonymous partner went out with that guy from the office. Well, maybe if it was someone from <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/">The Office</a>, we would care... Then on the other side of me I have the couple that is excitedly describing their free trip to the "cigarette company ranch" to some poor family. Man - thank god I was reading when those two showed up but I can tell you a set of <a href="http://www.bose.com/controller?event=VIEW_PRODUCT_PAGE_EVENT&product=qc3_headphones_index&ck=0">noise canceling headphones</a> will be purchased very soon. Too bad the darn <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> has that goofy recessed head phone jack. Hmm, this phone is getting more costly by the day.

Just another glamorous night on the speaking circuit. Hey - maybe Jake was on to something about my blog...either that or I've been reading way too much of <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/writers/peter_king/archive/index.html">Peter King</a>'s stuff. I promise, one of these days I'll write about something technical. Maybe. We'll see.

So - I thought this would be the end of the story, but alas it wasn't to be. First, shortly after I put my laptop away, we were told of a gate change and as is usually the case, it was essentially on the other side of the terminal. It's quite something to see a couple of hundred people all simultaneously bolt for the proverbial exits... Anyway, after settling in at the F concourse, the gate agent informs us that we're waiting on the pilots who are flying into (of course) G but as soon as they land, we'll start boarding so after they are spirited over we'll be ready to go (apparently their delay is why we're behind). Considering they could have just <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070727/northwest_cancellations.html?.v=3">canceled</a> the flight, this seemed acceptable.

After everyone was on board, the pilots arrived only to find that their dinners somehow hadn't managed to make it. The captain tells us he's very sorry but they're going to just run back into the concourse and grab a quick bite to eat - shouldn't be more than 20 minutes. Now, frankly, I want a pilot that's focussed on, you know, flying the plane and not on his rumbling stomach but still...this is turning into a long night. They finally return and we push off - alleluia!

After starting the engines, we (oddly) just sit on the tarmac. Given the hour and the lack of any weather, I found it strange that we weren't moving...after sitting there for a bit the pilot informs us that one of the three navigation computers is showing an error and since we need all three to fly, we'll have to pull back up and get it fixed. Now, I'm guessing the plane can actually fly without all three computers but at this point more than a few passengers are wondering what kind of hotel Northwest will be springing for tonight. Speaking of passengers, for whatever reason, I seem to be on a lot of flights filled with teeny-boppers. Now that I'm a thirty something and have a child I think I can say things like that.

Anyway, on this particular flight we had quite a number of that age group that is never wrong and this crowd was...interesting. First off, I'm not entirely sure how three of them managed to get an exit row - it's not like they needed the leg room and I doubt they have status. They also didn't handle the delays very well. One shouted "Northwest sucks" at least once and was quite proud of herself while others made angry comments to (one assumes) their legal guardians about the setbacks. Of course the young lady that said "we should have landed hours ago" clearly doesn't understand time...or how flight works. I can only assume she didn't quite grasp the time shift. Oh well.

Once we returned to the gate, three mechanics showed up and kept going in an out of the cockpit. At this point the stewardesses sprang into action and started handing out water. After about a half hour, things finally were under control - the pilot informed us that they had to "reboot" the navigation computers (I can only surmise they were using Windows Vista Supreme Ultimate Avionics or something similar). After a two plus hour delay, we were <strong>*finally*</strong> in the air and my adventure was over...or was it?

Upon landing in Phoenix, I called the hotel and asked for a shuttle - I was told it'd be five to fifteen minutes. OK, no problem, the hotel is <strong>*very*</strong> close to the airport so this shouldn't be an issue... Well, twenty five minutes later I called back wondering where the shuttle was and again I was told five minutes tops. Keep in mind that it's 1 am but my body insists it's 3. After another phone call, the shuttle finally arrives and I'm whisked to the hotel. I'm just happy Jay scheduled me for a later time slot this morning. Speaking of the hotel, I've got to say, what a comfortable bed! Kudos to <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/cp/1/en/hotel/PHXEA/">Crown Plaza</a> for doing what EVERY hotel should - they put a night-light in the bathroom. Such a simple thing yet this is the first hotel I've stayed at in recent memory that did that... Well, enough of this - time to shower and spread a little Ajax goodness!]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The last couple of days I've been involved in what I would essentially term a code review of some things our off shore team recently completed. To say there were some issues would be a bit of an understatement and it has certainly helped cement the need for <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">continuous integration</a>, frequent review, and a strong test suite. While I expected some odd use of inheritance, the empty interfaces caught my eye and I spent longer than I like explaining why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain't_Gonna_Need_It">YAGNI</a> would be the team's default position on pretty much anything. But none of that is really worthy of a blog post - that's just run of the mill coding stuff. No, the real inspiration was this little gem:

<code>
public class Constants {
&nbsp;&nbsp;public interface UIConstants {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static final String foo = "foo";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static final String bar = "bar";
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
</code>
Now, I know some people think that interfaces are the cat's meow for storing constants, heck, I even did it once in a past life (I was young, I needed the money) but I've vowed never to follow that antipattern again. Don't just take my word for it - Joshua Bloch calls it out in his must read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0201310058%3Fv%3Dglance%26n%3D283155%26s%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance&tag=ntschuttacom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Effective Java</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ntschuttacom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> (I for one can't wait for the updated version). I've done my part to eradicate this erroneous use of interfaces but when I saw the code above I was floored.

Frankly, I'm a little surprised it compiles but unfortunately it does. Of course I found myself asking <strong>*why*</strong> anyone would even think to use this approach. Wait, I can hear it know "we only have one place to go to look for constants and we have namespaces too." Um, OK, then please explain why there were a couple of other interfaces that were also called Constants and did you catch the whole antipattern comment? Furthermore, explain why you think it makes any sense at all to have an <em>interface</em> as a member of a <em>class</em>. Talk about abusing the constructs of Java.

Needless to say, we extracted those so called interfaces into real honest to goodness classes that couldn't be instantiated. And for those of you that will complain about how painful it is to write <code>UIConstants.foo</code> in your code, have you heard about <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/static-import.html">static imports</a> yet? Should you go down this road though <strong>*please*</strong> don't go overboard; as the Sun guide says:



<blockquote>If you overuse the static import feature, it can make your program unreadable and unmaintainable, polluting its namespace with all the static members you import. Readers of your code (including you, a few months after you wrote it) will not know which class a static member comes from.</blockquote>



Needless to say, it's been an interesting few days reviewing this code - I wait with bated breath to see what next week brings.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm a little tardy in getting the <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/san_jose/2007/09/index.html">Rich Web Experience</a> written up, I hope you'll forgive me. First off, I just want to thank the attendees - what a great audience! They were very engaged, asked a ton of great questions and really made for a fun few days for the speakers. In an neat bit of coincidence, I met <a href="http://www.joshholmes.com/default.aspx">Josh Holmes</a> from Microsoft on the plane out to San Jose - we spent most of the ride talking about <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> though his <a href="http://www.joshholmes.com/2007/08/14/AdventuresWithMappingAndOffroadFun.aspx">trip to Crested Butte</a> was quite something! Anyway, I hope <a href="http://molly.com/">Molly Holzschlag</a> is feeling better; her presence was missed but at least the opening panel <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/09/06/rich-web_1.html">managed to make InfoWorld</a> (you can't spell filibuster without <a href="http://www.davisworld.org/">Scott Davis</a> :) ).

Having no talks Thursday, I settled in with a full helping of <a href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/">Bill Scott</a> and <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Doug Crockford</a>. Bill <a href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/2007/09/announcing-protoscript.html">introduced</a> <a href="http://protoscript.com/">Protoscript</a>, a "simplified scripting language for creating Ajax style prototypes for the Web." I thought it was a pretty interesting tool and something that could really help those of us that build UI mockups (read more <a href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/2007/09/why-protoscript.html">here</a>). Doug talked about, you guessed it, JavaScript a topic near and dear to his heart (check out his stuff on <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/">YUI Theater</a> to get a taste of what you missed).

Friday I had to go to work! I opened up with my <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/show_session_view.jsp?presentationId=287&showId=60">Designing for Ajax</a> talk which was a hit. My audience was just fantastic - they asked a ton of questions and I had a real blast with this talk. From the comments I got afterward it sounds like people learned a bunch and had a good time. Later that afternoon I gave <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=406">Deconstructing Prototype</a> for the first time and it went pretty well I think. Bill's Antipatterns talk was great; it just amazes me that some of his examples ever made it out to the real world and I applaud him for being able to turn a critical eye towards his <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">employer</a>. That afternoon I taped a short video on UI/JavaScript etc. that will someday find its way to the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">NFJS</a> site - I'll be sure to post when it goes up.

<a href="http://blog.jjg.net/">Jesse James Garrett</a>'s keynote was quite something; his slide deck was quite a work of art and had many of the speakers buzzing. He's clearly a believer in the <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lessig</a>/<a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/">Presentation Zen</a> method; the use of images and words plus the integration of blank screens was worth the price of admission. I also enjoyed the case study from the <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> folks; they've got some great examples of Ajax on their site but what I respect so much is their belief in testing. According to <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/sean_kane.html">Sean Kane</a>, about 70% of the features his team dreams up never make it out of testing!

During the second expert panel Scott threw out the "what books do you recommend" question and as usual <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a> stole two of mine (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDreaming-Code-Programmers-Transcendent-Software%2Fdp%2F1400082463%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1189881321%26sr%3D1-1&tag=ntschuttacom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Dreaming in Code</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ntschuttacom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and another that I'm surprisingly blanking on).

While I really enjoyed the entire weekend, the highlight was <a href="http://www.humanized.com/">Aza Raskin</a>'s workshop on design. He discussed the "<a href="http://www.humanized.com/weblog/2006/09/11/monolog_boxes_and_transparent_messages/">monologue box</a>" (aka JS alerts) along with his solution of transparent messages. His examples of undo on the web were inspirational sparking a lot of discussion. Throughout his talk he showed off <a href="http://www.humanized.com/products/">Enso</a> and though I love <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> I wouldn't mind if Humanized ported that bad boy over to the Mac! Aza talked a lot about natural language which lead to the quote of the week:



<blockquote>Trying to remember the command for tar -gvf is like bobbing for apples in a cement mixer.
</blockquote>


Aza was good enough to join a handful of speakers at dinner after the show and he even tagged along for a couple of hours of pool. Good thing he and I are pretty close in skill at that particular game...though he did school me in air hockey. 

<img src="http://ntschutta.com/images/aza.png" alt="Aza Raskin prepares to defeat me in pool." />

Needless to say, it was a great evening and fantastic way to wrap up the conference. Neal and I did our best to recruit Aza for NFJS, he'd certainly be a welcome addition. Anyway, a great show and I'm really looking forward to next year when we'll have not one but two opportunities to get the web community together!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few weeks ago I had the <strong>*great*</strong> pleasure of seeing <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a> present on <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses">Data and Information</a>. For many years I've had his <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">books</a> on my "to buy" list but when the <a href="http://ruby.mn/">RUMies</a> organized a group to see him live, I just had to be there. Based on the conversations on the list and what I've heard elsewhere, my expectations were high - and they were exceeded; if you ever have a chance to see ET, take it. His delivery style is quite something and I found myself scribbling down a ton of notes.

ET opened with one of the most stunning things I've ever seen - the <a href="http://www.musanim.com/">Music Animation Machine</a> (see some examples <a href="http://www.musanim.com/watch/">here</a> and a discussion on Tufte's site <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00005y">here</a>). Though I'm not musical and I've never played an instrument, I immediately knew what these images meant and represented. The movie was the epitome of design; the screen wasn't cluttered and nothing in the display could be removed. This example led us into one the central themes of his presentation: whatever it takes to explain the content is the proper display. In other words, <strong>content is king</strong>, content should determine the display (content driven design as it were). Don't begin with a specific display approach, start with a content problem and do whatever it takes to explain the information.

Though this was the most prominent idea that I took away, there were a number of great concepts throughout the day. This list is hardly exhaustive but should give you a sense of what ET is all about.
<ul>
	<li>Details lead to credibility.</li>
	<li>There is no such thing as information overload, just bad design.</li>
	<li>Eliminate clutter.</li>
	<li>Great design disappears, it gives itself up to the content.</li>
	<li>Super graphics can be extremely useful.</li>
	<li>Every paragraph, chart, etc. should lend credibility to your argument and give your audience a reason to believe.</li>
	<li>There is no one "right way" to display data - try a few different approaches.</li>
	<li>The sports and financial sections of your newspaper are filled with great examples of table design.</li>
	<li>Tables are nearly always better than graphics.</li>
	<li>Don't get it original, get it right.</li>
	<li>Don't under estimate your audience - don't pander or patronize.</li>
	<li>The principles of analytical design are the same as the principles of analytical thinking.</li>

</ul>


Though ostensibly about visual design, much of what ET had to say applies directly to presentations (from both sides of the podium), a topic that he touches on near the end of his seminar. If you are a consumer, you should be very wary when the presenter won't share his data. As soon as you hear words like "proprietary" and "confidential" you can be assured the data is cherry picked, a crime second only to outright lying. Of course when you're presenting, be sure to shed light on the data - this will do wonders for your credibility. Speaking of presentations, you owe it to yourself to read through ET's <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1&topic=Ask+E.T.">breakdown of the key PowerPoint slides</a> concerning the damage to Columbia. Pretty powerful stuff.

Tufte spent a fair amount of time discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline">sparklines</a>, a "small, high resolution graphics embedded in a context of words, numbers, images." The prototypical example would be a <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AAPL">stock performance chart</a> though <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be">Beautiful Evidence</a> is full of <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR&topic_id=1&topic=Ask+E.T.">examples</a>. It's quite something to see just how much data can be expressed in small areas yet be incredibly easy to grasp. And there are a number of ways you can <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=sparklines&btnG=Search">generate</a> these for your own data!

I could go on and on but I don't want to bore my lone reader. To say I walked away impressed is an understatement; if you have a chance to see ET, do not hesitate. Just watching him present is worth the price of admission.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite our best efforts, many technology projects don't succeed (and a few that do define "success" in interesting ways...) Many many words have been spilt trying to answer why failure is so common and even more describing the one true way to counter that sorry state; I'm certainly not going to add to that ink bath but maybe I can give you a heads up that will save you the pain of yet another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_%28software_development%29">death march</a>. In a series of chats with various project survivors, I've assembled the following short list of signs that you it might be time to find something new.
<ul>

	<li>"The file extension is .java" is the first item on your code review checklist.</li>

	<li>You throw out a random <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA">TLA</a> in a meeting and no one misses a beat.</li>

	<li>The project manager says the data model is already 95% done.</li>

	<li>The use of the term "<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html">code smell</a>" is outlawed.</li>

	<li>Developers insist that unit testing will only slow them down.</li>

	<li><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/135269">Estimates aren't ranges</a>.</li>

	<li>Your manager tried to send people to <a href="http://www.waterfall2006.com/">Waterfall 2006</a>.</li>

	<li>Technologies are evaluated based on the quality of the golf course.</li>

 	<li>The first thing the tech lead does when he downloads a piece of open source software is hack the code.</li>

	<li>The term "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang_adoption">Big Bang</a>" is thrown around liberally.</li>

	<li>Your project structure requires an upgrade to your toolset in order to function properly.</li>

	<li>The architect is babbling like the Oracle at Delphi...and everyone is nodding.</li>

	<li>You feel the need to build a "concrete containment building" around a part of your code base.</li>

	<li>Your IDE is responsible for generating nearly all your code.</li>

	<li>All technical questions are answered with a recap of the project history.</li>

	<li>End users have update access to the production database tables.</li>

	<li>You do something special when your page has checkbox3.</li>
</ul>


Though influenced by my own experience, any resemblance to projects real or imagined is entirely coincidental... [Shortly after writing this, I was listening to a <a href="http://www.javaposse.com/">Java Posse</a> podcast that had a <a href="http://www.javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=255476">nice list</a> of project smells.]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like any industry, ours likes to pretend that today's problems are new and unique - it's part of how we justify our salaries. And while the demands on what we are expected to do with technology continues to exceed the gains made with improved <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">languages</a> and hardware, the more things change, the more they stay the same. For example, take collaborative work environments. With today's focus on outsourcing, far flung offices, and distributed supply chains, using technology to help distributed teams work together is a must. While some people might think this is a relatively new phenomena, in truth, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">Douglas Engelbart</a> (inventor of the mouse) was working on these issues back in the early 60's (a point <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Doug Crockford</a> made in his <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/09/20/reflections-on-rwe/">RWE</a> keynote).  A while back, I stumbled upon <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-533537336174204822">this video</a> of a presentation from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a> circa 1988.  
<embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-533537336174204822&hl=en" flashvars=""> </embed>
During the talk, Kay shows a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8734787622017763097">video of Engelbart</a> demonstrating some really amazing stuff. In the presentation, Engelbart works with a colleague located about 30 miles away - along with sharing the desktop, they've got full audio and video connectivity. Needless to say, I was pretty wowed.
<embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-8734787622017763097&hl=en" flashvars=""> </embed>
Further along, you see some amazing applications developed by school children! While some of this may seem quite simple today, you have to consider when this was filmed.  I've long been fascinated by novel ways technology is applied in the classroom - something beyond using a word processor or doing some research on the web. I have to wonder what has become of programs like those discussed in this talk. Of course now we have things like <a href="http://teachers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Teachers</a> but still, the focus seems to be on attendance and grades not on enhanced teaching methods.

These days you can't swing a short iron without running into some discussion of patent law and how it applies to software (or more often doesn't apply) but I was really surprised to hear it come up in the Q&A of Kay's talk! To paraphrase Alan, while he feels that protecting inventions is good, there is "enormous confusion between whatâ€™s an idea and whatâ€™s an inventionâ€. He argues that there should be some protection but that it is and can be abused. A little later, he argues for more than just a technical education and as a graduate of a <a href="http://csbsju.edu/">small liberal arts college</a>, I was very pleased to hear him urge computer scientists to get a liberal arts background arguing that the challenge is to find the aesthetic. Frankly, I think my BA in <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/computerscience/">computer science</a> makes me a far more well rounded individual and has allowed me to perform a wider variety of duties.  

Anyway, a very fascinating presentation by a giant of computing. I highly recommend you take the time to watch these; despite their age, they are still quite timely.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=591">Test Infecting</a> talk, I do my best to counter a number of myths that I (and others) have encountered when introducing testing into an organization. One of the most persistent misconception revolves around time - or rather the lack thereof. Many a developer has claimed they don't have time to test to which I generally reply with a <a href="http://www.parelli.com/home.faces">Pat Parelli</a> quote from <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/so_it_takes_les.html">this post</a> on <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a>'s blog:



<blockquote>"Take the time it takes so it takes less time."</blockquote>



Kathy was talking about multitasking but my point is simple: forgo testing and you'll pay that price plus more later when the defects start rolling in. While I <strong>*think*</strong> this is persuasive, <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/category/deans-deprecations">Dean Wampler</a> went one better by using charts which we all know makes for a better argument ;) Dean makes some great points in <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/09/30/why-you-have-time-for-tdd-but-may-not-know-it-yet">Why you have time for TDD (but may not know it yet...)</a> though the part about moving unscheduled project end time up earlier into the project really hit home.

<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/135269">Ranges are fine</a> and the key to success is frequent milestones; as we learn more about the problem domain and the technology we are using, the more accurate our estimates. But most organizations take a random guess (with, I'd say, a <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/10/09/winds-spittle/">wind's spittle</a> of support) and turn that into a concrete date around which the world turns. They then ignore all the little milestones (if they track them at all) or they <a href="http://www.ddj.com/architect/191600661?cid=Ambysoft">green shift</a> the project status. The result is failure, though sometimes we redefine that word to mean something else entirely...]]></content:encoded>

This connects to my own <a href="http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/archive/2006/05/22/137" rel="nofollow">"Theory of Business"</a>: that there are a lot of people in the business of software development who are more vested in internal perception than in actually helping the business make more money.

I love the phrase "Green Shift", BTW.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a heads up that I'll be speaking at <a href="http://twin-spin.cs.umn.edu/index.php">Twin SPIN</a> next week - here are the <a href="http://twin-spin.cs.umn.edu/events.php?id=148">details</a>. I'll be giving one of this season's <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/index.jsp">No Fluff</a> <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=591">talks</a>. Hope to see you there! Unfortunately that means I won't be at the latest edition of <a href="http://minnedemo.org/">Minnedemo</a> but I think that just gives you an idea of just how much tech goodness is happening in the Twin Cities these days.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had lunch with my friend <a href="http://www.unpossible.com/">Dan</a> on Monday (and finally got to a <a href="http://ruby.mn/">RUM</a> meeting...) and he mentioned that local guru <a href="http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/index.html">Mike Nygard</a> was on a <a href="http://pragprog.com/podcasts">recent Pragmatic Podcast</a>. As you might expect, I pointed iTunes at the feed and was not disappointed. Mike wrote <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mnee">Release It</a>, a very important book on making sure your code is production ready. Anyway, well worth a listen. Speaking of podcasts, my friends <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a> and <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/">Andy Glover</a>'s chat on JRuby et al is <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/podcasts/jtech/2007/112007jtech006.html">up on JavaWorld</a>. Good stuff guys! BTW, Andy, if you're looking for other people for podcasts, I  <strong>*cough*</strong> know a guy.]]></content:encoded>

So, the project name is PAW which apparently has something to do with Bears... I'm not really sure what it means to Build Direct but I'm in favor of Bear Stores. Though how that relates to resumes, cars, biker build offs and homes, well, I'll just never know.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the year comes to a close, I wanted to note a few interesting things I've read of late. I'm sure I could come up with a few hundred words about each but the kid is napping so I'll keep this short and to the point. I first ran across <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/december#sun-02-greys_law">this quote</a> on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> (a must read BTW) but seeing it <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/12/does-your-employers-wilful-ignorance-of.html">again</a> on Reg Braithwaite's <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Raganwald</a> spurred me to post it here:



<blockquote>Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice.
</blockquote>


Well, that explains an awful lot.

<a href="http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/">Mike Nygard</a> had an interesting post about some of the <a href="http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/2007/12/budgetecture_and_its_ugly_cous.html">common pathologies</a> we see in this silly industry. I found the part about negotiating particularly fitting but if you haven't seen budgetculture, I'd love to know where you work. My friend <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a> has his <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/12/27/2008+Predictions+2007+Predictions+Redux.aspx">annual prediction piece</a> - lots of very interesting fodder hiding in there. All I have to say is Granny Schottenwilkins has been a proud Mac user for years but I'm sure there are some Windows 98 users in Wisconsin.

Jeff Atwood's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Coding Horror</a> reminds us that we <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001020.html">all write shitty code</a>. I've run into some amazingly arrogant developers that were convinced everything they wrote was pure gold, too bad they're the types that generally don't read, well, anything. Speaking of Jeff, I liked his take on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001021.html">registration keys</a> though I'd point out that some companies trust their users...

Anyway, just a few good reads to finish off 2007. Happy New Year to all three of my readers!]]></content:encoded>

In case you're looking for a great one day software symposium, <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/">UMSEC</a> will once again be hosting <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze_08/">Code Freeze</a> January 17th from 8 to 5 at the McNamara Alumni Center. The price is right especially if you're a <a href="http://www.msse.umn.edu/">MSSE</a> alum. Our topic is innovation and we've got a great lineup of speakers (if I do say so myself) - hope to see you there!

After class we started chatting and he told me that the goal was to travel enough that you wanted to start traveling less - needless to say, I now know exactly what he meant (see <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/10/20/ah-travel/">here</a>, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/02/08/random-travel-notes/">here</a> and <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/06/03/thats-interesting/">here</a> for various tales of the glories of trips past...) For those of you that don't fly much, the <a href="http://jetlagged.blogs.nytimes.com/">Jet Lagged</a> blog's  <a href="http://jetlagged.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/a-users-manual-to-seat-21c/">A Userâ€™s Manual to Seat 21C</a> pretty well covers the joy that is getting on an airplane these days. Of course some of my <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/">friends</a> fly so much that <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">they</a> haven't seen a seat past row 4 in years but even <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">they</a> have their own horror stories to share ;).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ours is a very young profession - we don't have hundreds or thousands of years of experience. But we are blessed with some amazing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">pioneers</a> that did truly groundbreaking work - discovering things that are still amazingly <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8734787622017763097">powerful today</a>. Sometimes I think we forget our history or at a minimum fail to understand it. When you think about the essential paradigm of mainframe computing, it isn't that different from web applications, something I mentioned at <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/12/30/code-freeze-2008/">Code Freeze</a> (and something <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a> covers in his <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blogs/theater/archives/2007/10/the_state_of_ajax_douglas_crockford.html">State of Ajax</a> talk.)

Of course it isn't just raw technology that echoes its past - no, our development languages do as well. Look at the features we are <a href="http://gafter.blogspot.com/2006/08/closures-for-java.html">trying to add</a> to mainstream languages today - despite what some developers think, these aren't new ideas. Languages <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2007/11/language-spectrum.html">exist on a spectrum</a>, and many believe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language">Lisp</a>, invented fifty years ago, is the most <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html">powerful language</a> around (though it's <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/podcasts/jtech/2007/112007jtech006.html">hard to get paid to write it</a>.) Usually, things improve with time; I don't think any of us would trade in our <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">MacBook Airs</a> for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair</a> but apparently not so with languages - I'm not really sure what to make of that.

Anyway, back to history. On the way home from the Code Freeze speakers dinner the other night I was listening to the radio when I stumbled upon <a href="http://thestory.org/archive/the_story_429_A_Technical_Camelot.mp3/view">A Technical Camelot</a>, <a href="http://thestory.org/">the story</a> of Jean Bartik whose first job was as a "computer." Let me repeat that - her title was literally human computer (which makes more sense than some of the titles I've held frankly.) In the mid 40s, she found herself in the midst of history as one of the first programmers on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a> and listening to her describe how she became a programmer and the kinds of things she was working on was quite something.

My point here is simple: history matters. With the advances in hardware, we've done some amazing things, but let's not forget where we came from and the people that propelled us to where we are today.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few years back, my wife and I built a house. OK, so <strong>*we*</strong> didn't actually swing a hammer; if you've ever seen me attempt a project around the casa, you know hiring the project out was the sanest course of action. This was my second go round with home construction, a process that many say they'd never repeat. But hey, I'm a glutton for punishment so in we plunged! I'd mostly walled off the entire experience in that place we put painful events like child birth and two-a-day practices, but last week one of my projects got me thinking that maybe, just maybe, there's a comparison to me be made between house construction and building software.

Before I get started, I have to consider whether I'm on shaky ground here - many people have written pieces questioning the whole construction analogy. For starters, my friends <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a> and <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glen Vanderburg</a> have their takes with <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2007/11/building-bridges-without-engineering.html">building bridges without engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/Software/Development/building_bridges.rdoc">bridges and software</a>. Jack W. Reeves' classic <a href="http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design.html">What Is Software Design?</a> is a must read and <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Reg Braithwaite</a> has a great post about what he <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/01/what-i-admire-about-professions-like.html">admires about engineers and doctors</a> which has this money quote:



<blockquote>Try this: Employ an Engineer. Ask her to slap together a bridge. The answer will be no. You cannot badger her with talk of how since You Hold The Gold, You Make The Rules. You cannot cajole her with talk of how the department needs to make its numbers, and that means getting construction done by the end of the quarter.
</blockquote>


Considering the shared experience behind that impressive collection of wise words, I'm questioning my sanity to even think a construction analogy might fit software. But, even though I'm conflicted about the whole thing, I'm still going to share. Heck, maybe I'll learn something in the process.

When we built our house, we spent several weeks looking at model houses, poring over floor plans, looking at carpet samples - all sorts of fun stuff. Now, with the last "home project," during the requirements gathering phase we were just focused on the big issues: do you want a built in here? Would you like a fireplace? How about a skylight here? You know, the stuff you've got to get right before the foundation is set and the walls are up. At various stages, I'd get a call from the project manager (yep, that was his title, I'm feeling more confident already!) and he'd setup a time for me to come out to the site and work with one of the trades on issues like outlet placement. With my sample size of one, I expected a similar (iterative) process this go round - alas I was wrong.

You see, this builder had a different approach. They believed heavily in making all (and I mean <strong>ALL</strong>) the decisions up front (can you say <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front">BDUF</a>?) Being a software geek, I think I do a pretty good job of thinking abstractly but needless to say, it can be quite a challenge to figure out where you want your phone jacks when all you have to go on is a 2D model of your future dwelling. I pushed back on the builder and was told they did this for a reason - they felt that if everything was on the plan, I could go on (as they put it) a four month vacation and come back to a completed house <strong>*exactly*</strong> as I intended it to be.

As much as I wanted to believe the people I was about to give a very large check to, I wasn't convinced and as you might expect, my wife and I were on site pretty much every other day keeping track of what was going on. It was a good thing we were vigilant customers constantly running our acceptance tests. Nearly every visit revealed something that needed to be fixed, a story to be added to the backlog (or punch list in this case.) Some things were minor - a switch not controlling the proper light or a misunderstanding about what the plumbing code would allow. But others were, well, of the show stopper category. For example, despite a very clear floor plan showing where the washer and dryer were to be, the plumber decided he'd just put the washer where it was in every other house. Thank goodness we caught it early but this whole "we get it on the plan thing" certainly didn't work in practice.

So what the heck does this have to do with software? Well, one of my projects has a customer group that thinks like my builder - they want to give us all the requirements, we give them an estimate, then they don't talk to us until the project goes live. Obviously, this doesn't work too well. I'm not sure why people ever thought this approach worked, heck, if we can't get it right with houses (something we've been building, oh, forever) how can we possibly get close with a discipline as <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/01/19/human-computers/">new as software</a>? No, the answer is found in an <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile approach</a> where we work closely with our customers. Does that mean we need to see them for eight hours a day everyday? I sure hope not, but if they aren't willing to commit <em>some</em> time to the project, how important could it actually be?

Needless to say, we're trying to get the customers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different">think different</a>, to embrace a more collaborative approach and I hope we succeed. Otherwise, I have a pretty good idea what will happen after that four month vacation.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great post. I started building software like contractors build homes in 1972, using a general-purpose system framework and customizable reusable components and a collaborative process very similar to today's agile methods and incremental/iterational processes. That approach evolved into a generative component-based development process in about 1978, and I've been using it ever since. This combination of approaches affords a great deal of flexibility in terms the development process, and estimating the associated project cost and schedule. This enables working software to be built and reviewed in near real-time. The basic premise is to do the most challenging or important stuff first, transfer the most business value to the users as quickly as possible and identify problems as early as possible to mimimize costs. The generative part produces 75-90% of the total system code automatically; the rest is related to the code that differentiates one application from another, or modifications to the existing components to satisfy unique module requirements. The key to this approach is the degree of "granularity" of the component templates: too fine, and keeping track of everything becomes increasingly difficult as the application grows, too coarse and the number of modifications to generated components increases. Another benefit of the generative process is that multiple approaches to building the application may be explored in parallel with little risk. Modularization at this level enables specific functionality to be "localized", yielding substantial post-deployment benefits, like improved sustainabilily and extendability. (Some of the systems built this way have outlasted the platforms on which they were implemented several times over). These factors may provide extremely good TCO figures. The bottom line is this: being able to create bullet-proof custom applications in a fraction of the time and cost of other methods means that that risks typically associated with software development are substantially reduced, and payback comes much earlier. 

Thanks again for an interesting post.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Don’t doubt yourself. I think the construction analogy is still appropriate and sometimes even helpful.  It’s the engineering analogy that has always been misplaced and troublesome, in my opinion.  The example you give is, I believe, the best one for most software development projects.  The building of a custom house (or other building) is an excellent analogy to a custom software project.  There are engineering principles involved, but you wouldn’t refer to your average home builder as an “engineer”.  There are pre-built components that can be used.  There is an overall architecture. There is a more detailed design.  The construction process uses engineering principles and standardized tools to implement that detailed design while staying within the boundaries set out by the architecture.  Most of the work that is done while building a home is the same as the work that was done for the last one, but the outcome is unique and the problems that arise are also.  

Then there is your point.  Home construction, just like software, can be done following an agile or waterfall methodology.  Obviously, home construction can’t be quite as agile as software.  As Neal points out the manufacturing costs of software are much lower which means the cost of change is lower.  But the principles are still the same.  The cost of change increases the later the change is made.  How much more would it have cost if you didn’t catch that plumber in time?  Rapid feedback and flexibility are just as valuable in home construction as they are in software development.

So, I agree with you 100% but I am miffed at you for posting this.  Just yesterday I was thinking of finally getting into this blogging thing  (realizing that in our industry if you don’t blog you don’t exist) and I was going to write about this in my very first post.  Now I’m going to have to wait until I get another interesting thought.  Who knows how long that will be?  

Anyhow, great post.  Have a good time in Boston.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Pete,

Thanks for the insightful comment - you've hit on some key issues there. I've seen so many projects fail because they didn't deliver that business value early...they just spun on and on. Your point about risks resonates as well - it amazes me that customers and managers continue to cling to what is arguably a much riskier approach to developing software (and one that has a very poor track record of success I might add.) BTW, are you, by chance, the Pete named in <a href="http://media.pragprog.com/articles/sep_04_imaginate.pdf" rel="nofollow">Imaginate</a>?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dave,

Sorry I stole your topic ;) it wasn't deliberate! I sure hope you jump into the fray - the blogosphere can sure use more reasoned voices. I think those that abuse the construction analogy underestimate just how much "guess work" there really is in building a house (or any custom structure.) As you state, there's the overall architecture but when push comes to shove, the craftsmen have to make a lot of decisions...just like those of us building software. Gee, there's more to this than I thought!

Boston was great - a short trip with a VERY early wakeup call but I had a blast. Thanks for your comments!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Duplicate Flights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In early December, I did something that, a mere year earlier, I thought was pretty darn strange. I spent a Saturday in the last month of the year on a plane. <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/07/20/travel-notes/">Travel</a> you say? Gee, you've <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/07/28/a-quiet-friday-night/">never</a>, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/06/03/thats-interesting/">ever</a>, ever <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/02/08/random-travel-notes/">written</a> about <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/01/04/seat-21c/">that</a>. <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2006/10/20/ah-travel/">Ever</a>. No, this trip was different, this trip was special - I wasn't going anywhere; this time I was just getting status. I flew from Minneapolis to Chicago, walked one gate over to take a flight to Detroit, bought some chocolate for my mother-in-law (at <a href="http://www.gayleschocolates.com/">Gayle's Chocolates</a> you see!) and then retraced my steps back home. Since I'm not quite as frequent a traveler as <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted</a>, <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal</a>, <a href="http://vita-contemplativa.blogspot.com/">Brian</a>, <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/">Venkat</a> or the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_list.jsp">rest of the gang</a>, I needed a few more legs to put me <a href="http://www.nwa.com/worldperks/program/overview/">over the top</a> and spending a few hours in the air was the cure.

Of course I'm not the only one to do something like this - heck, the previous year a good friend of mine flew to Germany to retain her status. Yep, all the way to the land of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesling">Riesling</a> where she spent a few hours in the airport only to return home. I thought she was crazy, but now I get it.

Anyway, I checked my mileage summary a month or so ago and noticed I'd only received credit for two of the four legs leaving me ever so short of my goal. Luckily, the website has a form one can use to request credit so I gave them a few bits of information and sat back. A couple of weeks later I still didn't have the legs so I submitted the request again. Now, my miles program knows several ways to get in touch with me - they have my home address, a phone number and of course my email address. Yet I never received anything via any of these means explaining why my credit hadn't shown up. So, after digging around the site for a few minutes I finally found a phone number.

Today I called. As you might expect, I faced off with an elaborate phone tree that mostly wanted to tell me things I either already knew or could easily find online. Saying "Help" didn't, ah, help but pounding zero got the job done (should have used <a href="http://gethuman.com/">get human</a>.) After explaining my situation to the very helpful (I mean it!) agent, she quickly diagnosed the problem. You see, the software had decided my flights were duplicates since they occurred on the same day. Huh.

Now, I'll grant that what I did isn't on the happy path and represents a bit of an edge case but lets reason through this a bit. Let's imagine the query: <code>select flights where date = whatever they entered on the form</code>. OK, so if that returns multiple records we somehow decide some of those clearly are the same because, you know, <em>they happened on the same day</em>. Hmm, what <strong>*other*</strong> information might we be able to use to discriminate? Well, there's the departure and destination airports and last I checked flying to Chicago from Minneapolis isn't the same as flying to Minneapolis from Chicago. But, perhaps the system doesn't check for locations - after all the form only asks for frequent flier number, date, and ticket number.

If we grant that the location information might not be that helpful we're left to ponder...what else could we use to disambiguate these aberrational flights? How about flight number? Why yes, I think we've hit on something here! Each of these flights had a unique flight number. Wow, I can't <em>imagine</em> how a software program could possibly tell the difference between flight 656 and 676 (or whatever the numbers might be.) Yeah, that right there is one of those unsolvable problems, maybe the <a href="http://www.wired.com/cars/futuretransport/magazine/16-01/ff_100mpg_sb">X Prize Foundation</a> can get involved.

The agent (again, she really was very nice) took care of the problem but oddly, she couldn't just fix it for me. Nope - she had to <em>send an email to a clerk</em> and have them <strong>manually</strong> add my legs into the system (which apparently takes up to two weeks.) Boy, not only can't the system correctly tell the difference between two, ah, <strong>different</strong> flights, they don't even have an easy way for an agent to fix the problem. Sigh.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday, my wife had to print out a PDF; she went to our aging Windows box (I know, but every so often it's useful) and double clicked on the file in question. Nothing happened. Adobe Reader didn't open and no errors were displayed. I thought that was rather strange so I tried another PDF - as expected, it sprang to life. Huh - well, let's take a look at versions. Sure enough, we were a rev or two behind so I downloaded the latest and greatest. We tried the original file again and there it was in all its glory.

Now, I can't for the life of me understand what was so special about this file that it required the most up to date version of the software but it did. The lack of any notification is what sticks in my craw (and violates a couple of <a href="http://www.useit.com/">Nielsen</a>'s <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html">usability heuristics</a>.) Apparently Adobe just expects everyone to update their products in a timely fashion but if our proverbial grandparents are any indication, this might be a mistake. Should I have updated? Sure and I did, but is a simple message box saying something about needing version X to open this file too much to ask?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After listening to an <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2008/">OOPSLA</a> <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2007/index.php?page=podcasts/">podcast</a> about a workshop on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred Brooks</a>' widely read <a href="http://info.computer.org/portal/site/computer/menuitem.eb7d70008ce52e4b0ef1bd108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=computer_level1&path=computer/homepage/misc/Brooks&file=index.xml&xsl=article.xsl&;jsessionid=HvSGPqMQyCtxc7bQPQmz9vbKhC1lwQ8yypq9RQwG9HBfybxyFLFb!-449791248">No Silver Bullets</a>, I was inspired to reread his seminal piece. Though 20 years old, I was struck by just how applicable NSB is today and while there are a few things that place it in time, as I've said before, <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2007/10/06/the-more-things-change-2/">the more things change</a>, the more they remain the same. Heck, I even decided to assign it at <a href="http://www-users.itlabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2008/seng5199/">dynamic language camp</a>. Much of what Brooks writes about relates to accidental vs. essential complexity, a topic that's echoed by <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a> in <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2007/09/ruby-matters-meta-programming-synthesis.html">this post</a> and <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Reg Braithwaite</a> <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/07/abbreviation-accidental-complexity-and.html">here</a>. <a href="http://relevancellc.com/blog">Stu Halloway</a> touched on this at <a href="http://www.umsec.umn.edu/code_freeze_08/">Code Freeze</a> this year though he rephrased the concept as <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/2008/1/17/slides-posted-ending-legacy-code">essence vs. ceremony</a>. More and more, we're finally heeding the message found in this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._A._R._Hoare">C. A. R. Hoare</a> quote:



<blockquote>“Programmers are always surrounded by complexity; we cannot avoid it. ... If our basic tool, the language in which we design and code our programs, is also complicated, the language itself becomes part of the problem rather than part of its solution.”</blockquote>



Anyway, on to Brooks. In the spirit of a number of <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a>'s posts, I'll take snippets of NSB and inject my thoughts. Let's start near the top with this gem:



<blockquote>"[Germ theory] told workers that progress would be made stepwise, at great effort, and that a persistent, unremitting care would have to be paid to a discipline of cleanliness. So it is with software engineering today."

</blockquote>

Though perhaps not what he intended, I see this as yet another call for <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">continuous integration</a> as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixing_Broken_Windows">fixing broken windows</a>. It isn't easy, it takes a great deal of work, but when we fail to be diligent, our "patients" get sick. And anyone that's ever worked on decaying software knows how much fun that is...

This quote should be endlessly fed to those that think programmers are essentially typists:



<blockquote>"<em>I believe the hard part of building software to be the specification, design, and testing of this conceptual construct, not the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation.</em> We still make syntax errors, to be sure; but they are fuzz compared with the conceptual errors in most systems."
</blockquote>

This work is made up of thought stuff - and anything we do to disrupt flow will ultimately hurt our chances of successfully developing software.

To those that think some tool or modeling language will make software so easy anyone can do, I'd counter with this:



<blockquote>"The complexity of software is an essential property, not an accidental one. Hence, descriptions of a software entity that abstract away its complexity often abstract away its essence."
</blockquote>


In other words, software is hard...though we often make it harder. Sometimes that's related to our organizations:



<blockquote>"Much of the complexity that he must master is arbitrary complexity, forced without rhyme or reason by the many human institutions and systems to which his interfaces must conform. These differ from interface to interface, and from time to time, not because of necessity but only because they were designed by different people, rather than by God."
</blockquote>


Further confirming that the problems in software are largely people oriented, one can practically hear Brooks' echo in the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a>:



<blockquote>"The central question in how to improve the software art centers, as it always has, on people."
</blockquote>


<a href="http://whydoeseverythingsuck.com/2008/01/rip-mitch-kapors-chandler.html">Technologies don't kill projects</a>, people do and better programmers really are better, a point made by <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2007/10/developer-productivity-mean-vs-median.html">Neal</a> as well as <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">Paul Graham</a>:



<blockquote>"The differences between the great and the average approach an order of magnitude."
</blockquote>


These days, I'm asked often about how we're going to "scale up" our development teams which is really just management speak for "off shore 80% of the work." Now, fundamentally, I don't have any issues with taking advantage of vast labor pools, but I'd much rather have a small team of top notch developers than a large team of, well, less than average ones. I'm not sure if it's just the fiefdom complex or the overriding dictate of distant management, but big teams are usually problematic. With a few great developers, I can move the world. And let's never forget <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">garbage in, garbage out</a>.

Back to Brooks - he's more entertaining than I am. He touches on something near and dear to my heart praising higher level languages:



<blockquote>"Surely the most powerful stroke for software productivity, reliability, and simplicity has been the progressive use of high-level languages for programming. Most observers credit that development with at least a factor of five in productivity, and with concomitant gains in reliability, simplicity, and comprehensibility."
</blockquote>

Seems to echo with what people say about Rails, Ruby and a host of other languages these days. Expressiveness matters - a lot.

I'd argue this is largely what Stu was getting at in his <a href="http://relevancellc.com/assets/2008/1/17/EndingLegacyCodeInOurLifetime_1.pdf">Ending Legacy Code</a> talk:



<blockquote>"[Abstract types and hierarchical types] removes yet another accidental difficulty from the process, allowing the designer to express the essence of the design without having to express large amounts of syntactic material that add no information content. For both abstract types and hierarchical types, the result is to remove a higher-order kind of accidental difficulty and allow a higher-order expression of design."
</blockquote>

Getting rid of boiler plate and focusing on the problem at hand is key. I know a lot of developers who defensively shout "but my tool handles all that for me." Sure. See above. And don't forget, you or someone coming in behind you will still have to read all those excess symbols.

Though I wish buying new hardware would solve all our woes, Brooks reaffirms what we already know:



<blockquote>"More powerful workstations we surely welcome. Magical enhancements from them we cannot expect."
</blockquote>

Bummer. Guess I'll need a better reason to get that new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MBP</a>.

There's quite an agile flavor to NSB and a number of Brooks' comments speak very well of what is becoming a more and more common approach to writing software. I'm not sure about you, but I haven't seen much success with waterfall...but iteratively developing solutions seems to work, a point he makes quite clearly:



<blockquote>"Therefore, the most important function that the software builder performs for the client is the iterative extraction and refinement of the product requirements. For the truth is, the client does not know what he wants. The client usually does not know what questions must be answered, and he has almost never thought of the problem in the detail necessary for specification."
</blockquote>


Despite what some think, you just can't get it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front">all right up front</a>. This isn't some fundamental failing, it's a feature not a bug. Rather than attempt to fight this, just work with it; instead of trying to write it all on the plan before you break ground, iterate. Software types tend to be good abstract thinkers, but our customers often aren't - thus why getting working products in front of them early is so important:



<blockquote>"I would go a step further and assert that it is really impossible for a client, even working with a software engineer, to specify completely, precisely, and correctly the exact requirements of a modern software product before trying some versions of the product."
</blockquote>

The value in this approach seems to obvious yet it still isn't "the norm." I honestly cannot understand why customers don't demand this process.

I try not be as wordy as <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve Yegge</a> but Brooks summarizes my post on <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/02/05/maybe-software-development-is-like-building-a-house/">house building</a> in less than fifty words:



<blockquote>"Much of present-day software-acquisition procedure rests upon the assumption that one can specify a satisfactory system in advance, get bids for its construction, have it built, and install it. I think this assumption is fundamentally wrong, and that many software-acquisition problems spring from that fallacy."</blockquote>



He goes on to discuss growing software, an analogy that really speaks to me. I remember mentioning something along these lines to a former co-worker only to be rather rudely dismissed:



<blockquote>"Incremental development—grow, don't build, software."
</blockquote>


When I discuss agile with skeptics, I really try to hammer on this point:



<blockquote>"One always has, at every stage in the process, a working system. I find that teams can grow much more complex entities in four months than they can build."
</blockquote>

All I can say is, I'm no Fred Brooks. But what does he know right?

Systems that spin off for months (or years) without that iterative review tend to fail - often rather expensively. I remember one project many years ago where the client eventually ran out of money (remember the dot com implosion?) Due to decisions made outside my influence, we really didn't have anything he could use. Sure, he could "demo" the product, but he certainly couldn't sell it. We'd spent a great deal of time designing everything in the system - all the screens, all the interactions...too bad we hadn't spent more time building. Had we worked more iteratively, he would have had <strong>*something*</strong>. Oh well, lesson learned.

As I mature in this industry, I become more aware of our pioneers; as I find my path I discover how far out they saw. Though recent times have seen amazing advances, we have much to learn from our past.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like pretty much any office with more than 3 people, we struggle with the ephemeral concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management">knowledge management</a>. Now, this takes the guise of everything from cultural lore to more basic issues like where is the latest version of the FooBaz document but the moral of the story is simple: we're still trying to find the right approach. We have a corporate product that hardly anyone uses because it's slow, the search is horrid, and it has very rigid ideas around who can post what where.

Recently, a number of teams have started to use a different product, one they are finding to be far more useful then the corporate standard. Though it isn't officially supported, it's gaining quite a bit of traction throughout the organization. Imagine my surprise when an IS wide email goes out saying, in essence, that everyone should <strong>STOP</strong> using the product that's working and contact the head of the crappy product team immediately so they can "migrate you over" to the "standard." In other words, cease doing the thing that's working, not "wow, we'll fast track the adoption of this new tool since it's serving such a vital need." Makes perfect sense.

As I was reading the email, I thought of <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/">St. John's</a> (<a href="http://www.gojohnnies.com/">Go Johnnies</a>!). Anyway, around the time my father was in school, they built the <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/sjureslife/halls/bernard.htm">tundra</a> <a href="http://www.csbsju.edu/sjureslife/halls/patboni.htm">dorms</a> - named as such for the large open space between the bulk of campus and the dorms. Anyway, when they built the tundra dorms, they didn't put in sidewalks right away, they waited until the students had worn paths and just paved those. Rather then guess what route residents would take, they let the property emerge. Needless to say, this approach worked pretty darn well.

The parallel here is pretty obvious - right or wrong, the "students" are wearing a path towards this new tool. Now I'm sure we can argue that the corporate standard can do "everything the new tool can do and so much more", but the crowd has spoken. Instead of using scare tactics to keep people from using it, perhaps the bureaucracy would be better served by following the herd.]]></content:encoded>

Sure, video is all the rage on news sites but in the technical space I suspect it has something to do with their use in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts">evangelizing Rails</a>; how you couldn't be impressed by the original "<a href="http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov">build a weblog in 15 minutes</a>" is beyond me. Though I've yet to dig into any of the <a href="http://peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a> screencasts, I've heard they are absolutely top notch and my friend <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a> has an <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/media.jsp?id=52">IntelliJ show</a> up on the <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/">No Fluff</a> site.

Anyway, the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">Prags</a> have gotten into the mix with their <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts">own take</a> on this "new" medium. They've got five up at this point and I just bought the first installments of the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-dtrubyom/the-ruby-object-model-and-metaprogramming">Ruby Object Model and Metaprogramming</a>. A couple of things have really impressed me: first, there's no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a>. Once again, Prag shows that they trust their customers to do the right thing. In addition to iPhone ready videos, they have good old fashion QuickTime files and it's pretty had to beat the price. Oh, one last little touch - when you visit the site (and you're logged in) they've grayed out the screencasts you've already purchased. This may seem like a small and obvious detail but I could see a company "neglecting" that in the hopes someone might inadvertently purchase something twice.

I love podcasts and I'll always be surrounded by books, but somethings are just best conveyed via video. These days we've got a ton of great educational options, so if you're looking to learn something new or brush up on an old favorite, see if someone has a screencast. Heck, with today's tools, you could create your own!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It shouldn't be a big surprise that I prefer <a href="http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/2008/4/1/ending-legacy-code-in-our-lifetime">low ceremony</a> <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile</a> processes to their heavyweight waterfall brethren. While I'm certainly not anti-process, I've spent way too much time in meetings defining how we were going to write software. Recently I wondered, do other industries spend so much time on mundane details like templates for issue logs? Perhaps they do, but I doubt the architects of the new <a href="http://projects.dot.state.mn.us/35wbridge/index.html">35W bridge</a> spent a lot of time discussing the how they would document the plans for the new roadway.

Most companies I've worked for spend an awful lot of time and money on process. Much as no serious enterprise would ever consider deploying SAP or PeopleSoft without a hefty does customization, every organization wouldn't dare to use an off the shelf process. No, it's better if a group of people spend months coming up with the perfect approach and a set of presentations that would make <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Tufte</a> weep. Despite a lot of pats on the back, I've yet to see this effort lead to any significant business value, yet it is a persistent part of the environments I've worked in.

It seems to me that most companies focus on process for one of three interrelated reasons. First off, there are a number of people in technology that, well, aren't very technical. Some of these folks <strong>*used*</strong> to be, but many just bluffed their way into higher paying roles and well, they need things to work on. Of course not everyone needs to spend their free time brushing up on the finer points of the <a href="http://javac.info/">closures in Java</a>, but last I checked templates don't compile their way into working software.

Second, software projects have a nasty tendency to fail and to combat this fact, most organizations want greater control over the work. To accomplish this goal, they invent more and more process, more gates, more checkpoints. Of course it doesn't really work that way, and the tighter they grip, the worse things get (hmm, sounds like a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/quotes">Star Wars quote</a> to me.)

Project failure brings us to reason number three: plausible deniability. If (or is it when?) a project isn't everything it can be, we can always point the finger at the process as either a point of blame (if only the process had a few more gates...) or as an example of success (as in: we've got a great process now...) Following the corporate standard also gives managers et al an easy out: yeah, the project failed, but we followed the all mighty process.

Don't get me wrong, heroic software development isn't good either. I've worked in manners best described as fire fighting and frankly that's just too much stress for me (though some people I know absolutely thrive on that rush.) Like so many things, process lives on a continuum. At one end, we have absolutely nothing - hack and code, cowboy coding, whatever you want to call it. On the other end, we've got extremely heavyweight command and control approaches that attempt to plot out when every developer will use the bathroom.

Truth is often found between extremes and we should seek a balance. Do what's right for your project though I'll always favor the less is more camp. And before you spend the next few months creating the perfect process see if something off the shelf will work. Better yet, try some stuff and see what works for you - repeatedly ask yourself these two questions: what worked and what didn't; do more of the first and less of the second and you might just find yourself on a successful project.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://blog.toolshed.com/">Andy Hunt</a> recently posted a great piece: <a href="http://blog.toolshed.com/2008/06/stage-0-not-rea.html">Stage 0: Not Ready For Agile</a>. He was all set to give a talk at a company until, well, someone discovered he was coming. Turns out the manager that contacted Andy hadn't followed the non-existent <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/06/21/the-purpose-of-process/">process</a> and instead of congratulating him or her on bringing in a well known speaker, they decided it'd be better if it could never happen again.

As stunned as I was by this, I'm not surprised. Talk is cheap - it's easy to say you want to be (or are) agile but the proof is in the pudding. You can say you value collaboration but when there are three levels of indirection between developers and end users, that statement echos hollow.

Culture plays a huge role in how we build software; Andy lists several traits that indicate you might not quite be up to the challenge of agile. Some are fixed more readily then others but if your culture won't support it, you've got your work cut out for you. Unfortunately, cultural issues don't respond to technical solutions as <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Reg Braithwaite</a> says so well with <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/12/growing-sense-of-doom-washed-over-me-as.html">this quote</a>:



<blockquote>“Cultural problems cannot be solved with technology. If you are an advocate for change, ask yourself what sort of cultural change is needed, not what sort of technical problems need to be solved.”
</blockquote>


Changing culture is hard, but for many organizations, it's the critical first step towards better software.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Software is full of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilities">ilities</a> - those quality attributes that more seasoned veterans (or anyone that thinks beyond today's quarter) care an awful lot about. Some common non-functional requirements bandied about include scalability, reusability, flexibility, testability, availability, usability, adaptability, maintainability...really we could go on and on. Individually, none of these is more or less important than any other though depending on what you're building for whom, certain attributes are given more or less weight. If I'm working on a simple app to manage my wine collection, I probably don't care too much about scalability. But, when designing a ratings engine to process thousands of transactions, my concerns change. To put it succinctly, it depends and its always about tradeoffs.

Lately I've noticed a lot of projects value dateility above all else. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Say you've got an important industry conference in six weeks and you need to have a demo ready or on the close date of a merger the books have to be unified - I've been in situations where hitting a specific date really was critical to the success of the project.

But then there are those times where the date is arbitrary, it's pulled out the hat by some manager or VP in an effort to <a href="http://tales-of-an-it-director.blogspot.com/2008/06/i-quit-my-job-today.html">please their bosses</a> or curry favor with the person cutting the checks. I remember one project where the importance of the date was reiterated to us again and again, only to be told at the holiday party that the plan really had us finishing a couple of weeks after the all mighty date. That didn't sit well with those of us logging all that extra time and we spent most of the next month cleaning up the code in preparation for the next march.

Of course <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d54UU-fPIsY">dialing any ility to eleven</a> means <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000708.html">others will be turned down</a> to compensate. When we focus on the date at all cast, we stop testing, ignore best practices, and we're left with a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/">ball of mud</a>. We might have "saved" a little time, but odds are we've <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/so_it_takes_les.html">cost ourselves significantly more</a> in the long run. When <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/02/05/maybe-software-development-is-like-building-a-house/">building a house</a> or a bridge, the consequences of shortened schedules are easy to see; with software, it's harder to diagnose but no less real. High defect rates, difficult to use systems and high estimates for new feature work are typical markers of a rushed project.

The affect on team morale is evident to anyone that cares to see it. Nearly everyone I've worked with genuinely wants to do good work, they want to take pride in what they're building. When forced to do a half-assed job, they don't take it well. The key is <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Start_With_No.php">saying no</a>, to <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Build_Less.php">build less</a>, but finding a manager or VP willing to do that is nigh on impossible. Agile techniques help, but <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/06/21/culture-kills/">culture trumps all</a> - if people are rewarded based solely on hitting a date, success will be redefined to make sure the maximum bonuses are paid out.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Clearly I've kicked off a trend - one day, I post about <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/06/21/the-purpose-of-process/">process</a>, a few days later <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Reg Braithwaite</a> coins a <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/07/process-theatre.html">new term</a> and <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">the Daily WTF</a> posts an <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Slaves-to-The-Process.aspx">ode to process</a> ;) . OK, I've only got three readers so I know it's all just a big fat coincidence but still! Process theatre really does capture the notion perfectly; pointy haired bosses believe more templates, meetings and blind adherence to methodology are the answer to failing projects. Of course when you remove all decision making from the hands of sentient beings, you get a lost workday instead of someone just hitting the spacebar.

I'm not anti-process; you've got to have some framework to hang your work on. I plain can't stand dogma though and I thoroughly believe you need to test your processes just as much as you test your code. Is this document/meeting/hurdle saving us money? Resulting in better projects? Happier customers? Whatever the raison d'être, we should make sure it's actually delivering. Do more of what works, less of what doesn't. Rinse and repeat.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't get to go to quite as many conferences as I'd like but luckily more and more organizers are putting talks on-line or releasing interviews and other useful tidbits. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> is home to a bunch of <a href="http://research.google.com/video.html">Google Tech Talks</a> and the videos from <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/io/">Google I/O</a> are up (take a look at <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve Yegge</a>'s <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/io/server-side-javascript-on-the-java-virtual-machine">Server-side JavaScript on the Java Virtual Machine</a>.) I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> - Sir Ken Robinson's <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">talk on education</a> has been on my iPhone since day one and is a much watch.

Anyway, <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn Vanderburg</a> recently posted a <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/Speaking/jaoo_beauty.rdoc">link</a> to a conversation about <a href="http://blog.jaoo.dk/2008/07/02/what-makes-code-beautiful/">beautiful code</a> recorded at JAOO. The 20-ish minute chat is full of lots of nuggets including a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> reference. Software is much more art than engineering, something that is often lost of the non-technical and <a href="http://www.creativethink.com/">creativity</a> is (rightfully) getting more attention these days. I found myself nodding along throughout, well worth a watch.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I remember the first time I flew for business - I was working for a small consulting company and I was heading to Chicago for a few days of training. I was pretty excited to be on the road (and on expense account) but I was more than a little paranoid about loosing my laptop. Turns out I was right be be concerned: <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/07/hundreds_of_tho.html">nearly a quarter million go missing each year</a>. I've been traveling more then last couple of years but there's still a little gulp when I put my silver beauty on the old conveyor belt - so far so good (knock on wood) but I just hate having to take my laptop out of my bag along with my <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/on_the_implausi.html">oh so dangerous liquids</a>.

Driving home from Fourth of July fireworks, MPR had a blurb on this topic (<a href="http://www.publicradio.org/columns/futuretense/">Future Tense</a> has a wrap up in <a href="http://www.publicradio.org/columns/futuretense/2008/07/03.shtml#019185">this podcast</a>.) The TSA is proposing the <a href="http://gsnmagazine.com/cms/features/news-analysis/542.html">ultimate laptop bag</a> though the <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/tsas_ideal_lapt.html">usefulness to travelers is questionable</a>. I doubt I'd purchase one but I have admit, it would ease my mind if I didn't have to pull my MacBook Pro out of its safe, snug little case each time I went through security...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year's <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/events.jsp">Rich Web Experience</a> was a big hit with some of the top Ajax/JavaScript/Design experts around. This year we've got not <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/washing_dc/index.html">one</a> but <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/san_jose/2008/09/index.html">two</a> chances to get your web groove on! With fantastic speakers like <a href="http://molly.com/">Molly Holzschlag</a>, <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a>, <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Neal Ford</a>, <a href="http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/">Stuart Halloway</a> and <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/aboutus/david.php">David Verba</a>, you're sure to learn a ton. As usual, you'll get technically focused 90 minute sessions with tons of speaker contact, all meals included, a great party, and it's hard to beat the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">swag</a>. Early bird registration ends August 15th and attendance is capped so don't dawdle. I'll be <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/nathaniel_schutta.html">speaking</a> at both shows and I'm really looking forward to it - hope to see you there!

		<title>Vendor Presentations </title>
		<link>http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/08/26/vendor-presentations/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I sat through some vendor presentations and while I won't name names, I just have to say: learn to give better talks. If I had a dime for every speaker that said some variation of "if you can read this slide" I'd be playing <strong>*a lot*</strong> more golf. In what I can only call yet another example of how <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/">Scott Adams</a> hides out in my office, our friend Wally shows off a slide that I think I saw earlier this week.

<a href='http://dilbert.com/fast/2008-08-22/' title='Wally Presents'><img src='wp-content/uploads/2008/08/wally_presents.gif' alt='Wally Presents' /></a>

Oh, and saying "I hope none of you are color blind" isn't all that funny. Why do people feel compelled to jam twenty things onto one slide? Are the little bits of electrons that costly? I for one have a rather unique <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/speaker/nathaniel_schutta.html">presenting style</a> and while my slides don't do much as takeaways, I have yet to hear someone say they weren't spot on for presenting. And whatever you do, make an extra pass through your deck for typos; some may still slip through, but trust me, you're judged on them.

If you find yourself doing any amount of presenting, I beg you to attend a couple of <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters</a> meetings (the damn bell will cure you of filler words - ahs, ums, you knows - right quick.) Spend some quality time on Garr Reynolds' <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/">Presentation Zen</a>, help us all and absorb his lessons. Oh, and if you're sending people out into the field to represent your company, do us all a favor and send someone with passion. The last vendor talk I sat through nearly put me (and most of the attendees) to sleep and I assure you, that doesn't improve your odds of a sale.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Duct Tape and Bailing Twine</title>
		<link>http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/09/18/duct-tape-and-bailing-twine/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I spent my formative years on a small hobby farm. In addition to witnessing first hand the whole circle of life thing, I learned just how versatile duct tape and bailing twine can be. Of course I also learned that those temporary solutions rarely stood the test of time - or a stiff wind. Still, in a pinch, the quick and dirty solution isn't always wrong provided you understand the consequences.

In software, we're often pressed to slap something together, to hit a <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/07/02/dateility/">date</a>, to use duct tape and bailing twine. Sometimes that is absolutely the right thing to do - the merger closes on the 1st, booking revenue requires the product to be released in the current fiscal year or marketing needs a demo for a key conference. Like our temporary solutions on the farm though, these improvised systems aren't meant for the long term (or more than three users.)

While no one seems surprised when a quickly constructed lean-to falls over after a few days, people are stunned when jerry-built software isn't up to the task. Some of that is the nature of software - people can <strong>*see*</strong> the temporary nature of our quick fix in the real world, but it takes a developer to really appreciate the craptacular nature of some code.

The problem isn't (necessarily) with the quick fix, its expecting too much of that rushed work. Well, that and deciding that dates are far more important than, you know, quality. Many seem to forget the cost of releasing a bad product. Best case results in a pulled release or paradoxically another quick fix; worst case is a pulled product or lost customers.

So yes, sometimes we should cut some corners but we need to do so with our eyes wide open. And we need to make sure our customers understand the consequences of doing so.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Importance of Retrospectives </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we learned something important, the <a href="http://www.ntsb.gov/">NTSB</a> announced the <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/washingtonpostinvestigations/2008/11/report_design_flaw_caused_by_b.html?nav=rss_blog">results of their investigation</a> of the the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-35W_Mississippi_River_Bridge">35W bridge</a> collapse. Turns out it was a design flaw - some gusset plates weren't quite up to snuff. As a result of this tragedy, bridges of similar design will undergo much needed scrutiny and we won't see these types of designs in the future. Heck, by now engineering textbooks have probably already been updated.

Contrast this with the average failing software project. Maybe this is a bit of stretch (much like the <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2007/11/building-bridges-without-engineering.html">bridge construction metaphor</a>) especially considering that few software failures result in the loss of human life. But when was the last time anyone published a report about what went wrong with a multimillion dollar software collapse? No, we bury our mistakes (near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Hoffa">Jimmy Hoffa</a>) and pretend that the next time, when we do it JUST like we did it this time, it will work. It'd be too difficult to admit we did something wrong, even in the "safe" confines of our own organizations protected with lengthy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement">NDAs</a>.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective">Retrospectives</a> are a vital part of creating better software but to be effective it requires a level of maturity that few organizations posses. Taking an honest look back at what happened, what went well and what went wrong leads to better results but only if you can discuss the project/increment/whatever openly and more importantly change how you do things. Life is full of constant adjustments, why should software projects be any different?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rewrites Are Like Moving</title>
		<link>http://ntschutta.com/jat/2008/12/14/rewrites-are-like-moving/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Moving is one of those things that (hopefully) we don't have to do that often; it takes a lot of time and energy plus it is a real pain in the behind. But, every so often we have to pick up stakes and when we do, we're usually amazed at just how much stuff we've accumulated. This is particularly obvious when you're in college - I distinctly remember packing for the summer wondering how the heck I'd get it all home; I'd only needed one trip up in the fall, why would I need so many in the spring? And then it would occur to me. I'd made several trips during the year, where I'd innocently bring one or two items, maybe even a bag of stuff. Over time, the bits built up.

Software works the same way. Over time, a feature is added here, refined there and before you know you've got a mature product. And a messy codebase. Eventually this will lead to a rewrite often accompanied by a technology change of some sort or another (this time we'll get it right!) Rewrites can be pretty good projects but they're not without their perils. For one, customers usually won't spend much time defining requirements. I've often heard "it needs to work just like the old system...only better" with better being some vague hand-waving around a pet peeve or two.

In addition to vague requirements, rewrites tend to suffer from estimation fatigue. Customers are convinced that they need to have all of the old system's functionality (plus all the new doodads they thought up over the last 20 plus years) and they need to have it <strong>*right now*</strong>.  Like my college aged self in the spring, many customers loose site of the gradual build up in functionality of the existing systems and many will insist that the new one won't be useful until it fully replicates the old. That last statement doesn't hold water but good luck convincing someone that feels otherwise; the old system didn't have all its features on day one either but that's not the anchor point for the people asking for the new system.

Rewrites are an excellent opportunity to do some process reengineering and, if done right, usually results in a vastly improved workflow. Of course this requires us to look past the angry monkeys in our systems and think of how things <em>could be</em> rather than how they <em>currently are</em>. This step is often skipped though, and we simply end up further codifying the legacy approach. But at least it's in a new technology stack.

Whenever I've moved, I've used it as an excuse to prune some of the stuff I've accumulated over the years (hint - look for boxes that you didn't unpack the last time you relocated.) When you encounter a rewrite, see if you can't do the same, try to eliminate some features, reports or screens. Most customers will scream bloody murder when you suggest clipping things, but <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Half_Not_Half_Assed.php">half a product beats half-assed</a> any day of the week. Writing code is like writing prose, the important bits are the ones you cut - applying this approach leaves you with a smaller codebase that's easier to maintain. Besides, the code we don't write is bug free.

So, next time you're staring a rewrite in the face, see if you can't cut some of the detritus; odds are you don't really need all 283 "views." But instead of using words like eliminate, try defer - most customers will see that as less scary. Be sure to remind them that you can always add that in later when you have a better sense of what you actually need. Odds are those "must haves" will slip quietly to the bottom of the backlog.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm a bit late in announcing this, but along with fellow Fluff Talkers <a href="http://kensipe.blogspot.com/2008/12/speaking-at-code-mash-2009.html">Ken Sipe</a>, <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/">Andy Glover</a> and <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/">Venkat Subramaniam</a>, I'll be speaking at <a href="http://codemash.org/default.aspx">CodeMash 2009</a> this January! I'll be talking about Dynamic Languages and the JVM as well as Test Infecting the Legacy Organization. The show is sold out and I've got to admit the idea of hanging out at a water park in the middle of winter sounds darn appealing! Hope to see you there!

		<title>It Isn&#039;t the Uniforms</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're a football fan (American style) this is a <a href="http://www.nfl.com/schedules#Week">big weekend</a> - the AFC and NFC championship pit (pun intended) a couple of six seeds vs. a two and a four respectively. Much will be made in the off-season of just how the Cardinals made a <a href="http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/22981870/">Giants like run</a> or how the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/peter_king/01/10/ravens.titans.insider/index.html">Ravens went so far with a rookie quarterback</a> and you can bet your morning mocha that a couple of hundred coaches will be dissecting everything the champions did to win today's games. Yes, <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/c/charlescal203963.html">imitation is the sincerest form of flattery</a> and many will attempt to copy the winning formula.

It isn't just sports franchises that imitate each other and raid the winner's coaching staff, no, companies do the same thing. From performing the same morale sapping rifs to utilizing the same bland beige decor, corporate entities love to ape one another. Even within an organization, the "successful*" (however that is defined) VPs will find their ways quickly copied.

While we should certainly ask ourselves what's working and what's not, we need to make sure we understand what actually is working. Take Arizona's success for instance. It may make sense to look at their offensive approach (as well as their coaching staff) to see what gems one might find. However, it takes a great deal of effort to find the golden nugget and most won't put in the time. No, many will take a shortcut and insist that the Cardinal's owe their Cinderella year to the color of their uniforms or the fact that Kurt Warner wears a glove on is throwing hand. Not only is the superficial easier to find, it is far easier to implement. Uniforms can be changed in a few days, establishing a winning tradition can take years.

In the technology space, it's tempting to just copy a specific technology stack and it's certainly easier to just buy the same vendor supplied vaporware than to hire better developers. But chances are you won't be capturing the true essence of their success, you'll just change the color of your uniforms.

So before you run off and decide that all new software in your organization should be written in that awesome new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_software_engineering">CASE tool</a> that's Bob's team uses, be sure that's the real secret sauce and not an ancillary fact. Odds are if you dig a little deeper you might find something else, something actually worth replicating.
---
* Unlike the sports world where a win is a win, success in the corporate world can be defined and then redefined especially when someone's bonus is involved. Worse, sometimes one area's success comes at the cost of the overall organization.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Keynote 09</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been a big believer in <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a> since shortly after it came out - at first I didn't see what all the fuss was about, but after using it for a few months, I had to create a presentation at work and I was reminded of how painful PowerPoint is. There was no going back, I was sold on Keynote. Like so many things in the Apple ecosystem, it isn't any <strong>*one*</strong> feature that makes the difference, it's a collection of little things, some of which you didn't even know mattered until shown another way. Unlike it's cousin from Microsoft, Keynote is designed to help you create slides that won't make users yak and it's particularly well suited for those that believe in the <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/10/the_lessig_meth.html">Lessig method</a> (see his <a href="http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/">Free Culture talk</a> for an example.) At this point, I can't imagine using anything else for a real world talk.

Every year, we're treated to a new version of Keynote (and the rest of its <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork</a> brethren) which means we get a collection of new features: transitions, themes, better charts and now new ways of sharing our work with others. Keynote 09 is no exception, this year we've got magic move and you can even use your <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> as a remote. Before this year's <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2009/02/07/speaking-at-qcon-london/">conference series</a> kicked off, I went ahead and upgraded and while I'm quite pleased I did run into one issue.

As I crafted one of my early decks, I noticed that one of my favorite transitions from Keynote 08 was gone - for example, I couldn't find confetti. 
<img src="/images/no_obsolete_transitions.jpg" alt="Keynote 09 stock transitions." />
It may seem strange for an unabashed promoter of <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/">Presentation Zen</a> and <a href="http://blog.duarte.com/">slide:ology</a> to be married to a transition, but I go out of my way to use them judiciously. A slew of Google searches later, I had my answer - some transitions were considered obsolete in Keynote 09. Enabling them is quite simple, simply go to the Keynote preferences and select "Include obsolete animations in choices." Perhaps I should just accept the wisdom of Apple and, ah, transition to the new animations but I've just got to have my confetti!
<img src="/images/keynote09pref.jpg" alt="Keynote 09 preferences - enable obsolete." />

The other big change I noticed was the vastly improved printing dialog. While nothing has fundamentally changed in the dialog, with 09, you get a handy preview of just what you're going to print (or save as PDF - one of the unsung features of OS X.) 
<img src="/images/keynote09Print1.jpg" alt="Keynote 09 print dialog - vastly improved, now with a handy preview!" />
You can also change the page setup from within the print dialog, something that is very handy when you're creating PDFs for handouts.
<img src="/images/keynote09PrintPage.jpg" alt="Keynote 09 print dialog - vastly improved, now with a handy preview!" />
Oh and for those of you that like the black or gradient background, if you don't want to kill an ink cartridge, select "Don't print slide backgrounds or object fills."
<img src="/images/keynote09Print2.jpg" alt="Keynote 09 print dialog - vastly improved, now with a handy preview!" />
Keynote is an invaluable part of any presenter's toolbox - if you think its just an Apple version of PowerPoint you're wrong. If you haven't tried it out, you owe it to yourself to use it for your next talk, it really does make a difference.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Vendors are Risky Too</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["We're not a software company" is a common refrain these days; ever since Nicholas Carr's "<a href="http://www.nicholasgcarr.com/articles/matter.html">IT Doesn't Matter</a>," it seems like more and more companies are bending over backwards to prove they don't do IT. In the process, some consultancies have made a ton of money, often by "replacing" a given company's IT department with the newly hired agency replete with people from....the company's former IT staff. More than a few of my friends went to work one day as an employee of company X only to enter the office the next day via a contractor badge. As companies aped one another, we heard more and more about "core competencies" and how smart companies stuck to what they did best.

Implicit in this arrangement is a transfer of risk - and many (on both the business and IT side of the shop) equate vendors with risk free, or at least, if things go south we have a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um=1&sa=1&q=homer+strangling+bart&btnG=Search+Images&aq=f&oq=">throat to throttle</a>. While it can be empowering to scream at a vendor rep, that doesn't mean you'll get your problem solved - or that they'll even be inclined to try. Vendor priorities mar or may not line up with yours and more often than not, that service contract entitles you to the C squad, not the A players they showed you during the courtship.

Make no bones about it, when you saddle up with a vendor, it's a commitment, one you best enter into with your eyes open. Just like with your spouse, year two is rarely the same as the first date and having a phone number to call doesn't mean you'll get an answer you'll like - or even an answer at all. Sure, you can open a problem ticket, but when will it be resolved? Don't hold your breath, unless your CIO calls their CIO at least. Oh, and never assume the vendor's developers write higher quality code than you do - some of the worst smelling <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/">balls of mud</a> were slung by people working for "software companies."

While we're on the topic of software companies, don't automatically think that the vendor is anymore of a "software company" than you are. It may <strong>*seem*</strong> like they're in the same camp as Microsoft or Oracle, but take a look at their income statements - does "professionals services" make up a large percentage of the bottom line? Odds are it does, the software is the modern day equivalent of <a href="http://itotd.com/articles/295/giving-away-the-razor-selling-the-blades/">razors</a>; they'll darn near give it away (OK, if you call 7 figures "give") so they can line up a nice fat services contract (mmm, smell the subscription fee!) In some cases, your odds of successfully implementing the project rapidly approach zero without a significant investment in contractors at $250 an hour and up. Nice work if you can get it.

Speaking of contractors, before you pull the trigger on that shiny box of vendor joy, take a look around the job boards to see if anyone is looking for developers with that skill set. Better yet, have your HR people look over recent job applicants to see how many boast time with your new love. Staffing models aren't always at the forefront, but if you can't hire people to twiddle the vendor bits, take a look around your cube farm and be sure you've got something people will want to train up on. Don't be surprised when your techies aren't thrilled by the notion of babysitting a piece of packaged software.

Once you've committed to a vendor, you live life on their schedule. Occasionally you might be able to nudge things but chances are you'll be treated like the rest of the huddled masses. In some cases this might be just fine, but in others it can have a significant impact on your business. Found a critical bug? Odds are that won't be fixed until the next release...sometime next year. You're also stuck with their priorities and again, while you might have some influence here, more often then not, your pet feature isn't so important to the decision makers at Vendor Co.

When you bring in a vendor, expect a platform play - and not all platforms are created equally. The excitement in Java land these days isn't over Java the language, it's Java the platform that gets the much deserved press for housing the likes of <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, <a href="http://wiki.jruby.org/wiki/Main_Page">JRuby</a>, <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> (hint, your developers would love to play with any of the preceding) and a host of others. While the Java platform (and it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime">peer from Microsoft</a>) offer a slew of choices, the vendor's platform is probably designed like the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea0CDieb4yM">Hotel California</a>; once a company has invested time, effort and money, they will usually continue to throw good money after bad.

I'm not saying you should never purchase a vendor product - far from it. You shouldn't write your own database server, you own app server, <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx">your own OR mapper</a> or your own build framework (OK, maybe as a replacement to Maven, sure I can see that.) But when it comes to core competencies, the things that make your company special, that's not something you should be too keen on farming out. As my friend <a href="http://www.nealford.com/">Neal Ford</a> is fond of saying, <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2005/01/software-development-time-warp.html">smart companies understand that IT is strategic</a>.

When it is time to purchase some software, perform a true evaluation - and one that's up to date. Just because the Foobaz team gave the product the thumbs up <em>three years ago</em> doesn't mean they'd say the same thing today. Heck, that team might not have even considered the same criteria you are. Too often, we either run through a script that is oddly similar to the vendor's demo or we try out a couple of hello world size examples; you've got to spend some quality time with a product to figure out when <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2007/11/ruby-matters-frameworks-dsls-and.html">Dietzler's law</a> kicks in. Regardless of what you're evaluating there are certain things you should pay extra special attention to:

<ul>
	<li>The testing story. If a tool doesn't have a good <strong>*automated*</strong> testing story, fail, or as we say in the project room, <a href="http://lighthousepatriotjournal.files.wordpress.com/2006/09/frog-in-lettuce_joan-b.jpg">frog in a bag</a> (FIAB for short).</li>
	<li>Version control. Repeat after me: copying the files to the LAN isn't version control. Life without source code management just isn't worth living, if the tool doesn't fit within something like <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> or <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, your evaluation is over.</li>
	<li>Can you diff the artifacts? I'm a fan of pictures, but show me the tool that can diff that fancy BPEL visualization. Oh and good luck with those massive XML files.</li>
</ul>


I'm sure you have other criteria too (Neal has a good list in <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2009/02/tools-anti-behavior-soa-tarpit-of.html">part three</a> of his SOA series) but these three are absolute deal breakers for me. Again, I'm not saying you should build everything, but when you do choose to purchase, be sure you know what you're getting into. Can you live with the constraints? Are you comfortable with the tradeoffs? If so, I wish you all the best. But don't blithely assume vendors aren't risky.]]></content:encoded>

I've been a proponent of the testing meme for most of my career but I've also spent much of that time convincing reluctant coworkers (and managers) that testing was in their best interest - the article takes my talk of the same name and puts it to paper. All <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home.jsp">NFJS</a> attendees get a complimentary copy of of <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/magazine_subscribe.jsp">NFJS, the Magazine</a>, but anyone is free to <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/magazine_subscribe.jsp">subscribe</a>. Each month you'll get an eclectic mix of articles written by <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_list.jsp">NFJS speakers</a> on topics they are passionate about; if you'd like to see a sample article, check out <a href="http://agileartisans.com/main/blog/">Jared Richardson</a>'s <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/s/magazine/nfjs_the_magazine_sample_march2009.pdf">A Case for Continuous Integration</a> [PDF].

		<title>Good Ideas Aren&#039;t Always New</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2009/02/07/speaking-at-qcon-london/">QCon</a>, <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn Vanderburg</a>, <a href="http://www.michaelfeathers.com/">Michael Feathers</a> and I (there may have been others, as I recall some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_(beer)">ESB</a> was involved...) were talking about Mike's <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/02/26/10-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice">10 Papers Every Programmer Should Read</a> post (if you haven't read it, please do so now, I'll wait. No really, go on.) A lot of programmers aren't particularly well read, a fact that Mike laments, and we kicked around some theories as to why that is - here's mine.

Why don't we look at our past? I believe it has to do with the natural (10 year or so) cycle of language dominance. People who've never programmed in language n-1 look at the syntax in a book from, say the early 90s and scoff; they complain that they don't know that language thus they can't read the book. I've heard more than a few developers dismiss Design Patterns because the code wasn't in Java, of course <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wwcT08lk-DcC&dq=tate+beyond+java&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=7UXE5UBYzT&sig=mSSfNSCIu4sFNYcPp1g1o66CMzY&hl=en&ei=JW3uSZy4C4zCMe70oPYP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#PPP1,M1">Java is starting to wane</a> - a couple of days ago I was researching a book and noticed it had a bunch of negative reviews because the example code was Java!

Many developers are essentially <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Blub programmers</a> and they can't imagine life in any other language. Further, they firmly believe that anything that existed before Blub is the modern day equivalent of the Pony Express, antiquated and useless. To some, all the good ideas are new, and we have nothing to learn by studying our past, I suspect many of these people have never seen <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8734787622017763097&q=engelbart">the mother of all demos</a> (though maybe we have <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntentionalSoftware.html">something new</a> to rival that now.) A typical Blub programmer assumes that any book that doesn't use Blub isn't worth his time and thus misses out on a wealth of learning. They almost willfully ignore the past which explains some of the reactions to Mike's post.

I've been doing my best to read my way through 10 papers and this afternoon I came to Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham's <a href="http://c2.com/doc/oopsla89/paper.html">A Laboratory For Teaching 
Object-Oriented Thinking</a>. Now, many people assume the whole agile software thing is just a few years old but here we see waaaaaaay back in 1989, a reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain't_Gonna_Need_It">YAGNI</a> and a plug for teamwork:



<blockquote>We stress the importance of creating objects not to meet mythical future needs, but only under the demands of the moment. This ensures that a design contains only as much information as the designer has directly experienced, and avoids premature complexity. Working in teams helps here because a concerned designer can influence team members by suggesting scenarios aimed specifically at suspected weaknesses or omissions.
</blockquote>


Great ideas then, a great ideas now. We're a young industry, one that is further hamstrung by the belief that the language/technology/process du jour is all that plus a bag of chips. We've obviously made some huge strides, but in so many ways we've barely moved. But for the video quality, Engelbart's demo could have just as easily been from 1988 or even 1998; sure, we've all got a mouse on our desk, but what about that 5 fingered keyboard? Not so much. Heck, every language is just trying to reinvent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language">Lisp</a>, and that's more than 50 years old! Don't be afraid of the past, those old guys knew a thing or two. We only hurt ourselves by ignoring the lessons they have to teach us.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over on <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/">JavaWorld</a>, you can see my latest article: <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-05-2009/jw-05-javascript-tools.html">Ajax: Tools of the trade</a>. If it's been a while since you looked at client side development and you still think alerts are the end all be all of web debugging, you might want to give it a read. Here's the official summary:

<blockquote>Where JavaScript developers were once tool-deprived, today we're often overwhelmed with the abundance of options. In this article, Foundations of Ajax author Nathaniel T. Schutta reviews development environments, debuggers, testing tools, and utilities that elevate JavaScript to first-class status in the Web development world. If you're still programming JavaScript in a text editor, this survey of the modern tools landscape should open your eyes -- and could make your life much easier.</blockquote>

If you like the article, you might also want to listen to the <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2009/01/26/javaworld-podcast-ajax-developers-toolkit/">podcast</a> of <a href="http://thediscoblog.com/">Andy Glover</a> and I <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/podcasts/jtech/2009/011209jtech.html">chatting about Ajax, JavaScript, testing and more</a>. Enjoy!]]></content:encoded>

I can't say enough good things about QCon, it's a great show with some amazing talks - if you have a chance to go, you really should. But, if getting to London or San Francisco (two of my absolutely favorite cities) isn't on the radar screen, the next best thing is watching the fantastic videos you'll find posted regularly on InfoQ.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>It's a new year and one of my resolutions is to post more - and to write up my thoughts on the books I read throughout the year. Looking at my <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/recent-reads/">Recent Reads page</a>, it's obvious I've let that lag a bit... With that in mind here is the first of what I hope is a relatively steady stream of reviews.
</em>
Based on <a href="http://twitter.com/KathySierra/status/6502399523">effusive praise</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/kathySierra">Kathy Sierra</a>, I picked up Cliff <a href="http://www.beyondbullets.com/">"Beyond Bullet Points"</a> Atkinson's latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321659511?ie=UTF8&tag=ntschuttacom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321659511">The Backchannel: How Audiences are Using Twitter and Social Media and Changing Presentations Forever</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ntschuttacom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321659511" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. <a href="http://twitter.com/cliffatkinson">Atkinson</a>'s book is an exploration of how social media sites like <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> are changing the landscape of public speaking and while I wasn't quite as blown away as Kathy was, there certainly are some good points to be found in this quick read. I'll start with the positive and then finish up with my criticisms.

I can understand why Kathy is so fond of this book - throughout, Atkinson reminds speakers of a vitally important lesson: it's about your audience stupid. Too many speakers epitomize the "me me me" approach of presenting and that's a recipe for failure. Though I find the "four tweet" model bit minimal (especially for longer talks), it is a useful exercise that I'll be incorporating into my talk prep. Again, the notion here is to focus on your audience and really think about the key ideas you're trying to communicate. I also like thinking about Twitter sized bites - making your talk "Twitter friendly" is valuable advice.

The concept of a presentation home page is rock solid and I think I'll play with that as well; starting (and fostering) conversation should be the goal of a modern talk. Considering the wealth of ways people can consume information today, live presentations need to offer something compelling to capture an audience. Turning a talk into one leg of a more immersive experience is a worth exploring.

While there certainly were some strong points in The Backchannel, I felt it took too long to get to the key points which is ironic considering Atkinson's repeated advice to do so in a presentation. I suspect there was an effort to inflate the page count a bit - the first half of the book could be condensed quite a bit. Case in point, I was surprised to see a chapter that was devoted almost entirely to setting up a Twitter account. A number of the graphics did little to add to the material, in many cases, they stated exactly what was already on the page. It also felt like the book was written on Twitter - so many of the sentences and paragraphs seemed to adhere to a 140 character limit.

Atkinson has a great list of ways the backchannel can blow up but not nearly enough advice on just how to recover when faced with those situations in real life. I understand he wants us speakers to <strong>*think*</strong> about how we'd handle that situation (and that's great advice) but I was hoping for more of his thoughts here; I wanted more hard won experience from people who've lived to tell the tale. The backchannel blowup case studies were useful but again, I wanted more "here's what they should have done..."

Though a bit light on content, the last couple of chapters make this book worth reading. Atkinson reminds us to focus on our audience and our message and he has some practical advice for dealing with the realities of modern presentations. Just as we can't turn back the clock to when bullet point laden talks were the norm, we can't put the Twitter genie back in the bottle. But we can do a better job of engaging and leveraging these tools to make more compelling presentations.

Yes, my dad came through in a big way and allowed me to join the likes of <a href="http://www.nealford.com/">Neal Ford</a>, <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/">Stu Halloway</a> and <a href="http://thirstyhead.com/">Scott Davis</a>...but back to Pollan's book. Omnivore's Dilemma starts with a simple question: where does our food come from? Pollan follows a humble hamburger back to the corn fields of Iowa and ultimately the oil fields of the Middle East showing us how the lack of diversity on the modern farm isn't doing the farmers, the environment or our midsections any favors. No, it seems modern agriculture is designed to benefit large multinational corporations more than anything else. Shocking. Some will shun meat after reading about its processing but me, well I like a good burger. However, we'll be picking up some grass fed beef from <a href="http://www.thousandhillscattleco.com/">Thousand Hills</a> shortly...

Part two explores the organic movement from the amazing synergy of a true farm ecosystem consisting of cows, chickens, pigs and grass working together in concert to the, shall we say, less noble minded large scale operations that see a market to tap. We consume a fair amount of organic food but there's no comparison to what we get all summer long from our local CSA, <a href="http://foxtailcsa.com/">Foxtail Farm</a>. Thanks to Pollan, I'm more skeptical of the organic label though I still think its ultimately for the better and I'm even more convinced that supporting local growers is an important step - we get better food that's produced in a more sustainable way.

The last part of Omnivore's Dilemma looks at hunting and gathering with Pollan crafting an entire meal that he scavenged. He creates an amazing meal that reminds us that food isn't just about shoveling sustenance into our maws - it's about connecting with those we love. And it really is stunning what you can find if you know where to look though I won't be hunting mushrooms anytime soon...

Omnivore's Dilemma isn't a new book but it's still relevant and will definitely change how you approach food. I have a different mindset at the grocery store now and I try to follow Pollan's advice on diet: "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html">Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.</a>" Whether you do all your shopping at <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods</a> or the quickie stop, arm yourself with Pollan's teaching; you'll eat better and ultimately you'll feel better.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525951571?ie=UTF8&tag=ntschuttacom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0525951571">Freedom (TM)</a> is Daniel Suarez's followup to one of my favorite books of 2009 - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451228731?ie=UTF8&tag=ntschuttacom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0451228731">Daemon</a>. Required reading for last year's Hackers B and B, Daemon is a geek friendly book that includes a main character using a perfectly realistic SQL attack to hack into a computer (there's no "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFUlAQZB9Ng">this is UNIX</a>" moment from Jurassic Park here.) Suarez is to geek what Tom Clancy is to military: dead on details abound. I tore through Daemon and I hotly awaited the conclusion of his epic tale. I was not disappointed.

The Daemon is the creation of an ultra rich (mad?) genius game designer Matthew Sobol. When Sobol dies of brain cancer, he unleashes his program on the world where it reeks havoc. Throughout his first book, we're lead to believe the Daemon is ultimately an evil creation but Freedom(TM) shows us the other side of Sobol's work. Indeed, we find a new world order emerging as darknet members (people who've joined with the Daemon) form new communities committed to sustainability (it's easy to see where Suarez was influenced by <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/2010/01/22/omnivores-dilemma/">Omnivore’s Dilemma</a>.) Of course the old guard fights back as it sees its power and influence begin to wane...

I don't want to say too much and ruin anything, but if you're a geek, a gamer, a programmer or just someone that likes a fast paced action filled book, well then Freedom(TM) is your cup of tea. Some may be put off by the heavy handed political commentary but I wouldn't let that stop you from giving it a go. I hope this isn't the last book from Suarez though he's set the bar awfully high.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Loved both books. Daemon was certainly one of my favorite books of the last couple of years. I have passed it on to other programmer-types and they love it too. I was not sure how Freedom(tm) would turn out, but I was pleasantly surprised. More from Daniel Suarez please. 

BTW, attended three of your sessions at NFJS in Chitown. You did nice job! Thanks for the good info.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, I spoke at the <a href="http://www.nejug.org/events/show/107">New England Java Users Group</a>, one of the biggest and best around. I had a rocking good time, the audience was outstanding and <a href="http://dave-klein.blogspot.com/">Dave Klein</a> (author of the outstanding <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356468?ie=UTF8&tag=ntschuttacom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356468">Grails: A Quick-Start Guide</a>) was even there! Anyway, one of the attendees, Deborah Hamill (VP Engineering at <a href="http://www.accordare.com">Accordare</a>, Inc.), was kind enough to collect up all the links I referenced during the talk - <em>including ones that weren't even on my slides</em>! Many thanks Deborah, I appreciate it. By the way, said slides can be found <a href="http://ntschutta.com/jat/conference-slides/">here</a>.
